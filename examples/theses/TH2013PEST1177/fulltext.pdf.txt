	  Abstract  
Dry Anaerobic Digestion (AD) presents different advantages if compared to wet AD, i.e. smaller 
reactor size, lesser water addition, digestate production and pretreatment needed, although several 
studies have demonstrated that water promotes substrate hydrolysis and enables the transfer of process 
intermediates and nutrients to bacterial sites. 
To better understand the role of water on AD, dry and semidry digestion tests of selected complex 
organic substrates (food waste, rice straw, carrot waste), with various TS contents of the treated 
biomass have been carried out in the present study. The results confirm that water plays an essential 
role on the specific methane production rate, final methane yield and Volatile Solids (VS) 
degradation. The final methane yield in semi-dry and dry conditions was 51% and 59% lower for rice 
straw and 4% and 41% lower for food waste, respectively, if compared with wet conditions.  
Inhibition tests, based on Volatile Fatty Acid (VFA) analysis, were carried out to investigate the 
specific inhibition processes that take place with the selected substrates at different TS contents. In 
wet AD of carrot waste no VFA accumulation was found, and all VFA concentrations were lower than 
the inhibition limits. A direct correlation between TS content and total VFA (TVFA) concentration 
was noticed for rice straw and food waste AD. For rice straw a maximum TVFA concentration of 2.1 
g/kg was found in dry condition, 1 g/kg in semidry conditions and 0.2 g/kg in wet conditions, whereas 
for food waste the TVFA concentration was 10 g/kg in dry condition, 9 g/kg in semidry conditions 
and 3 g/kg in wet conditions.  
A Mathematical model of complex organic substrate AD in dry and semidry conditions has been 
proposed to simulate the effect of TS content on the process. The data obtained from batch 
experiments, in terms of methane production and VFA concentrations, were used to calibrate the 
proposed model. The kinetic parameters of VFA production and degradation, calibrated using the 
experimental data, resulted highly dependent on the TS content and different from wet AD literature 
values. This is due to VFA accumulation in dry conditions, which implies lower values of the kinetic 
constants function of the TS content introduced in the model.  
Finally, as dry AD takes usually place in Plug Flow (PF) reactors, an historical and critical review on 
the role of hydrodynamics in PF bioreactors has been carried out.

 Sommario  
 
La digestione anaerobica (DA) a secco presenta diversi vantaggi rispetto a quella ad umido legati alla 
riduzione delle dimensioni del reattore, al minore consumo di acqua, alla più facile gestione del 
digestato prodotto, e alla mancata richiesta di pretrattamenti. Al contempo, tuttavia, il minor contenuto 
di umidità può comportare dei problemi nello svolgimento delle reazioni di trasformazione, giacché 
l’acqua promuove l’idrolisi dei substrati in trattamento, ha una azione di diluizione nei confronti di 
eventuali intermedi di processo che potrebbero inibire il metabolismo microbico, e permette il 
passaggio dei nutrienti e dei metaboliti attraverso il protoplasma cellulare.  
Per meglio comprendere il ruolo dell’acqua sulla DA sono state effettuate prove di digestione batch a 
secco, semi-secco, ed umido, adoperando tre substrati diversi, vale a dire: scarti alimentari misti, 
paglia di riso e carote. Ai substrati è stato aggiunto un inoculo pre-digerito, il cui contenuto di solidi 
sospesi è stato opportunamente variato attraverso un processo di disidratazione. I risultati ottenuti 
hanno confermato che l’acqua svolge un ruolo fondamentale nello sviluppo del processo, 
influenzando sia il tasso di produzione specifica di metano che la produzione complessiva di 
quest’ultimo, oltre che le cinetiche di degradazione del substrato, e quindi il rendimento di riduzione 
dei Solidi Volatili.  
Nello specifico, prendendo a riferimento la produzione complessiva di metano ottenuta nel processo 
ad umido, adoperando come substrato la paglia di riso i valori sono risultati ridotti di circa il 50% 
nella digestione a semi-secco, e di circa il 60% nella digestione a secco. La riduzione è risultata meno 
sensibile nel trattamento degli scarti alimentari misti, per i quali si è avuta un decremento del 4% nel 
corso del processo a semi-secco, e di poco più del 40% nel corso del processo a secco.  
Il monitoraggio della concentrazione degli acidi grassi volatili (AGV) nel corso delle prove ha 
consentito di evidenziare gli eventuali accumuli di composti inibitori in funzione del substrato trattato 
e della concentrazione di solidi totali (ST). A riguardo si è osservato che nel caso della DA ad umido 
delle carote, non si è avuto alcun accumulo di AGV e tutte le concentrazioni misurate sono risultate 
sempre inferiori al valore limite d’inibizione. Nel caso della DA della paglia di riso e del rifiuto 
alimentare, è stata invece individuata una relazione lineare tra il contenuto di ST e la concentrazione 
di AGV. Più in dettaglio per la paglia di riso è stato trovato un valore di concentrazione massimo degli 
	  AGV pari a 2,1 g·kg
-1 nel processo a secco, ed un	   valore minimo di 0,2 g·kg
-1 nel processo ad umi2d	   	  o,	   	   	   	  
 mentre nel processo a semi-secco la concentrazione si è attestata su un valore intermedio, pari ad 1 
g·kg-1. Nel caso della paglia di riso le concentrazioni rilevate sono state di 10 g·kg-1 nella digestione a 
secco, di 9 g·kg-1 nella digestione a semi-secco, e di 3 g·kg-1 nel processo ad umido.  
I risultati ottenuti nel corso delle prove sperimentali sono stati interpretati alla luce di un modello 
matematico all’uopo sviluppato, in grado di simulare il processo di digestione di substrati organici 
complessi, tenendo conto del diverso contenuto dei ST che caratterizzano i processi a secco, semi-
secco ed umido. La calibrazione del modello, effettuata sulla base di valori misurati relativi alla 
produzione di metano ed alla concentrazione degli AGV, ha consentito di verificare come i parametri 
cinetici relativi alla produzione ed alla degradazione di tali acidi siano fortemente dipendenti dal 
contenuto di ST, e, nel caso dei processi a basso contenuto di umidità, notevolmente diversi dai dati 
proposti in letteratura per la DA ad umido. Questo risultato è legato all’accumulo di acidi che 
comporta una riduzione delle cinetiche di degradazione dei substrati organici complessi di partenza e 
dei successivi intermedi delle trasformazioni in fase acquosa. Considerato che la DA a secco viene 
solitamente sviluppata in reattori con flusso a pistone, la parte conclusiva del lavoro è stata infine 
dedicata all’analisi storico-critica dei lavori presenti in letteratura relativi alla modellazione 
idrodinamica dei processi biologici, ed al ruolo che le diverse configurazioni reattoristiche possono 
avere nello sviluppo delle cinetiche di trasformazione, nell’ottica di porre le basi per una modellazione 
c	   ompleta della digestione a secco, comprensiva sia della parte idrodinamica che di quella biochimica.

 	  Resumè 
La méthanisation par voie sèche possède différents avantages par rapport à la méthanisation par voie 
humide. Les réacteurs sont plus petits, les besoins en eau sont moindres, la production de digestat et le 
prétraitement nécessaire sont également moins importants. Cependant, plusieurs études ont démontré 
que l'eau favorise l'hydrolyse du substrat et permet le transport des sous-produits d’hydrolyse et des 
nutriments vers les bactéries. 
Pour mieux comprendre le rôle de l'eau lors de la méthanisation, des tests de digestion sèche et semi-
sèche à partir de substrats organiques complexes (déchets alimentaires, paille de riz, déchets de 
carotte), avec différentes teneurs en matière sèche de substrat traité ont été réalisées. Les résultats 
confirment que l'eau joue un rôle essentiel sur le taux de production spécifique de méthane, le 
rendement final de méthane généré et la dégradation de la matière volatile sèche (MVS). Le 
rendement final de méthane produit dans des conditions semi-sèches et sèches est respectivement de 
51% et de 59% inférieur avec la paille de riz et 4% et 41% de moins pour les déchets alimentaires en 
comparaison avec des conditions humides. 
Des tests d'inhibition basés sur l’analyse des acides gras volatils (AGV) ont été menées pour étudier 
les processus d'inhibition spécifiques qui ont lieu avec les substrats sélectionnés à différentes teneurs 
en matière sèche. Pour le cas de la méthanisation par voie humide des déchets de carotte, aucune 
accumulation d’AGV a été trouvé, et toutes les concentrations d'AGV étaient inférieurs aux seuils 
d'inhibition. Une corrélation directe entre la teneur en matière sèche et la concentration totale d’AGV 
(AGVtot) a été mise en évidence pour la paille de riz et les déchets alimentaires. Pour la paille de riz, 
une concentration d’AGVtot maximale de 2,1 g / kg a été trouvé pour la voie sèche, 1 g / kg dans les 
conditions semi-sèche et 0,2 g / kg dans les conditions humides, alors que pour les déchets 
alimentaires la concentration d’AGVtot était de 10 g / kg à l'état sec, 9 g / kg dans les conditions semi-
sèche et 3 g / kg dans les conditions humides. 
Un modèle mathématique de la méthanisation de substrats organiques complexes dans des conditions 
sèches et semi-sèche a été proposé pour simuler l'effet de la teneur en matière sèche sur le processus. 
Les données obtenues à partir d'expériences en mode batch, en termes de production de méthane et de 
concentration d'AGV, ont été utilisées pour calibrer le modèle proposé. Les paramètres cinétiques de 
production et d’élimination d’AGV ont été calibrés à l'aide des données expérimentales, et il a été 
	  montré qu’ils sont fortement dépendants de la te	  neur en matière sèche et différent des valeurs de4	   	  la	   	   	   	  
 littérature concernant la méthanisation par voie humide. Cela est dû à l'accumulation d’AGV dans les 
conditions sèches, ce qui implique d’utiliser des valeurs plus reduit concernant les constantes 
d'inhibition introduites dans le modèle. 
Enfin, comme la méthanisation par voie sèche a généralement lieu dans des réacteurs à écoulement 
piston, une étude historique et critique de la littérature concernant la compréhension du rôle de 
	  l'hydrodynamique dans des bioréacteurs à écoulement piston a été réalisée. 
	  Samenvatting 
Droge Anaërobe Vergisting (AD) biedt verschillende voordelen in vergelijking met natte AD: kleinere 
reactorvolumes, minder water toevoeging, lagere digestaat productie en minder voorbehandeling nodig, 
ondanks dat verscheidene studies hebben aangetoond dat water de substraat hydrolyse en de 
uitwisseling van tussenproducten en nutriënten van en naar de bacteriële sites bevordert. 
Om de rol van het water in AD beter te begrijpen, zijn in deze studie droge en halfdroge afbraaktests 
uitgevoerd met geselecteerde complexe organische substraten (voedselafval, rijststro en wortelafval), 
met verschillende Totale Vaste Stof (TS) gehaltes van de behandelde biomassa. De resultaten 
bevestigen dat water een essentiële rol speelt in de specifieke methaan productiesnelheid, de 
uiteindelijke methaanopbrengst en de afbraak van de organische stof (VS). De uiteindelijke 
methaanopbrengst onder semi-droge en droge omstandigheden was, respectievelijk, 51% en 59% 
lager voor rijststro en 4% en 41% lager voor voedselafval in vergelijking met natte omstandigheden. 
Remmingsproeven, gebaseerd op vluchtige vetzuren (VFA) analyses, werden uitgevoerd om de 
specifieke remming van de geselecteerde substraten bij verschillende TS concentraties te 
onderzoeken. Gedurende de natte AD van wortelafval werd geen VFA accumulatie gevonden, en de 
VFA concentraties bleven lager dan de inhibitiewaarden. Bij de AD van rijststro en voedselafval werd 
een direct verband tussen het TS gehalte en de totale VFA concentratie gevonden. De maximale totale 
VFA concentratie bedroeg 2,1 g/kg voor rijststro bij droge, 1 g/kg bij halfdroge en 0,2 g/kg bij natte 
AD, terwijl voor voedselafval de totale VFA concentratie 10 g/kg bij droge, 9 g/kg bij halfdroge en 3 
g/kg bij natte AD bedroeg. 
Een wiskundig model voor de AD van complexe organische substraten onder droge en halfdroge 
condities werd ontwikkeld om het effect van de TS concentratie te simuleren. De data van 
	  batchexperimenten, met name methaanproductie	    en VFA concentraties, werden gebruikt om 5h	   	  et	   	   	   	  
 ontwikkelde model te kalibreren. De kinetische parameters van VFA productie en afbraak, 
gekalibreerd met experimentele data, bleken sterk afhankelijk van de TS concentratie en verschilden 
aanzienlijk van de natte AD literatuurwaardes. Dit komt door de VFA accumulatie onder droge 
omstandigheden, dit leidt tot lagere inhibitiewaarden die in het model zijn opgenomen.  
Ten slotte, omdat droge AD gewoonlijk plaats vindt in Plug Flow (PF) reactoren, werd een overzicht 
van de geschiedenis van dit reactortype gemaakt en de rol van de hydrodynamica in deze PF 
bioreactoren kritisch geëvalueerd.

CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Problem Description  
 
Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is a biological process historically applied to wastewater treatment sludge, 
that reduces Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of complex organic substrate and converts it into a gas, 
which is mainly composed by methane and carbon dioxide. During this process organic matter is 
progressively converted into simpler and smaller sized organic compounds obtaining biogas and 
digestate as final products. This digestate is rich in nutrients and microelements and it is suitable for 
utilization in agricultural contexts (Esposito et al. 2012a,b). Nowadays there is a pressing need to 
manage correctly bio-waste from its generation stage to its safe disposal and to reduce its impact on 
the environment. Therefore AD can be used as biological treatment as it is one of the best option to 
achieve at the same time the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol and the EU Policies concerning 
renewable energy and organic waste disposal. 
Based on the solid content of the influent bio-waste, AD can be defined dry, semidry and wet. In dry 
AD (high-solids digestion), the feedstock to be digested has a Total Solids (TS) content higher than 
15%. In semidry AD the solid substrate to be digested has a TS content ranging between 10%-15%. In 
contrast, wet AD (low-solids digestion) deals with diluted feedstock having a TS content lower than 
10% (Li et al. 2011; Zeshan and Annachatre, 2012). In the last decades, dry AD has got much 
attention due to its many advantages: smaller reactor volume, reduced amount of water addition, 
easier handling of digested residues, minimal nutrient loss (Karthikeyan and Visvanathan, 2012; 
Zeshan and Annachatre, 2012) and simplified pre-treatments compared to wet systems. The only pre-
treatment which is necessary before feeding the wastes into a dry AD reactor is the removal of coarse 
materials larger than 40 mm (Vandevivere 1999). Because of the high viscosity of the treated bio-
waste, in dry AD, the substrate moves via plug flow inside the reactor. Plug flow conditions within the 
reactor offer the advantage of technical simplicity. They leave however the problem of mixing, which 
is crucial to guarantee adequate inoculation and reduce acidification problems. 
The economical differences between wet and dry systems are small, both in terms of investment and 
operational costs. The differences between those systems are more substantial in terms of 
environmental issues. For instance, while wet systems typically consume one m3 of fresh water per 
ton of treated Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW), the water consumption of their 
	  dry counterparts is ten-fold less. As a conseque	  nce, the volume of wastewater to be discharged8	   	  is	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION 
several-fold less for dry systems (Vendevivere 1999).  
Despite the listed advantages, this high solid contents determine also several technical disadvantages 
in terms of transport, handling and mixing compared to wet processes (Lissens et al. 2001; De Baere 
et al. 2010; Bollon et al. 2013). Moreover the low amount of water affects the process development. 
The water content in fact is a key parameter of dry AD as several studies have demonstrated that 
water promotes substrate hydrolysis and enables the transfer of process intermediates and ease the 
bacterial community access to nutrients (Lay et al. 1997a, b; Mora-Naranjo et al. 2004; Pommier et al. 
2007; Bollon et al. 2013).  
The present study is aimed at better understanding the role of water on AD, discussing in detail the 
experimental data obtained during dry and semidry digestion tests of selected complex organic 
substrates by varying the TS percentages of the treated biomass. Obtained data are used to model the 
effect of water content during dry AD. Moreover, considering, as mentioned previously, that AD takes 
usually place in Plug Flow reactors, this study analyses also in detail the hydrodynamic conditions of 
different bioreactors through an historical and critical literature review of the role of the 
hydrodynamic behaviour on biological processes. This review was done to create the premises for the 
development of a mathematical model able to simulate the dry AD in real biological reactor.  
1.2. Objectives of the Study 
The main objective of this research is to investigate the process performances of AD reactors, studying 
the effect of moisture content on process development. The research was carried out at lab-scale in 
batch reactor on the following substrates: rice straw and food waste. These two substrates were 
selected because food waste is representative of readily biodegradable bio-waste, while rice straw is 
representative of slowly biodegradable ones. Moreover both of them are produced in large amount and 
there is a practical need to define a proper treatment for them. Further investigations are conducted on 
carrot waste to study the effect of moisture content also in the case of wet AD and to analyse the effect 
of particle size on methane production. This substrate was selected because it presents a shape and a 
consistency that can be easily modelled. Mathematical modelling aimed at upgrading the Anaerobic 
Digestion Model n. 1 (ADM1) proposed by Batstone et al. 2002 by considering the effect of moisture 
on the process performances is also an objective of this thesis. The experimental data obtained during 
batch studies were used to calibrate the proposed model. The specific objectives of the research 9ar	  e

substrate (i.e. food waste);

described the experimental and modelling results obtained on carrot waste wet AD. The batch tests 
results are used to discuss the effect of different particle size and moisture content on methane 
production. In chapter 3, the experimental results obtained on wet, semidry and dry AD of food 
waste are described. The effect of different moisture contents on methane production, VFA 
concentration and anaerobic degradation in terms of VS and COD is discussed. In chapter 4, the 
experimental results obtained on wet, semidry and dry AD of rice straw are described and 
discussed following the same approach used in chapter 3 for food waste. In chapter 5, an up-
graded version of the ADM1 model for dry and semidry anaerobic digestion is proposed. Mo1d0el

calibration is performed by fitting the experimental data (methane production and VFA 
concentrations obtained during the batch tests described in chapter 3 and 4) on food waste and rice 
straw in wet, semidry and dry AD conditions. In chapter 6 are reviewed mathematical models of 
anaerobic and aerobic non-ideal flow reactor in wastewater treatment are reviewed. Finally, in 
chapter 7 an overall discussion and conclusion of the results is reported.

CHAPTER 3 - EFFECT OF MOISTURE CONTENT ON ANAEROBIC DIGESTION OF FOOD 
WASTE 
2.1 Introduction  
Anaerobic digestion is a multi-step process, that involves several micro-organisms: hydrolytic, 
fermentative, acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria. The limiting step of the AD process can not be 
unequivocally defined. Acetogenesis (Hills and Robert 1981; Bryers 1985; Costello et al. 1991a, b; 
Siegrist et al. 1993) and methanogenesis (Graef and Andrews 1974; Moletta et al. 1986; Smith et al. 
1988), as well as hydrolysis (Vavilin et al. 2001) and disintegration (ADM1, Batstone et al. 2002, 
Esposito et al. 2008, 2011a,b, 2012a,b), can constitute the rate-determining steps. 
When considering complex organic matter, the hydrolysis of complex polymeric
 substances becomes the rate-limiting step and modelling of this process has to be improved 
(Pavlostathis and Giraldo-Gomez 1991; Vavilin et al. 1996b, 1997, 1999; Batstone et al. 2002). In 
particular, several models showed that the presence of OFMSW particles can be better described with 
the introduction of a disintegration step. This step individuates the physical break and transformation 
of the complex organic matter in soluble particulate organics, and represents the rate-limiting step of 
the process (Hills and Nakano 1984; Sharma et al. 1988; Esposito et al. 2008, 2011a, 2012a; Batstone 
et al. 2002).  
Several authors investigated the rate of hydrolysis and disintegration as a function of different 
parameters such as pH, temperature, hydrolytic biomass concentration, type of particulate organic 
matter and particle size (Pavlostathis and Giraldo-Gomez, 1991; Veeken et al. 1999; Hill and Nakano 
1984; Esposito et al. 2008; Sharma et al. 1988; Sanders et al. 2000). However, it is less understood 
how the TS content can affect hydrolysis and in particular the disintegration step of complex organic 
substrate. There are several attempts in the literature to model the effect of moisture content on dry 
and semi-dry AD process. In particular in their work, Abbassi-Guendouz et al. (2012), by the 
application of ADM1 model, found a decreasing first-order hydrolysis rate constant for carbohydrates 
by increasing TS content. This constant was calibrated using batch experimental data with cardboard 
as initial substrate and imposing the TS content in the range of 15-30%. This finding is in agreement 
with results presented by Bollon et al. (2011). There are also several attempts in literature to 
investigate the effect of TS content on methane production by operating Specific Methanogenic 
Activity (SMA) tests and by simulating experimental data by using the Gompertz model (Le Hyaric et 
al. 2011; Le Hyaric et al. 2012; Lay et al. 1997a, 1997b, 1998). These authors suggested also that high 
TS content could reduce substrate degradation, resulting in a lower methanogenic activity. These 
CHAPTER 2 - EFFECT OF MOISTURE CONTENT ON WET ANAEROBIC DIGESTION OF 
COMPLEX ORGANIC SUBSTRATES 
results are consistent with several studies performed by Qu et al. (2009), Fernández et al. (2010), 
Forster-Carneiro et al. (2008), Pommier et al. (2007), who found a reduction of methane production 
with higher TS. All these studies showed that the moisture content plays an essential rule in the biogas 
formation as the nutrients and substrates for the microorganisms must dissolve in water phase prior 
they can be assimilated. Furthermore, the moisture content is an important factor also in the low-solids 
(wet) anaerobic digestion because it supports the bacterial movement and helps substrate and product 
diffusion through the porous medium (solid waste) to bacterial cell membrane (Lay et al. 1997a; Lay 
et al. 1997b; Mora Naranjo et al. 2004; Le Hyaric et al. 2012; Pommier et al. 2007).  
The aim of this chapter is, therefore, to assess the impact of the moisture content on wet anaerobic 
digestion of a selected complex organic substrate. To better evaluate the impact of the water content 
on the AD performances, computer solution using a new version of the ADM1 of complex organic 
substrate, proposed by Esposito et al. (2008, 2011a,b) is applied. The model is used to describe the 
experimental data and to define the dependence of the disintegration kinetic parameter on the particle 
size and moisture content. 
More in detail, this chapter includes the following objectives: 
• propose an experimental procedure for obtaining an inoculum at different moisture contents; 
• investigate the effect of PS effect on the disintegration step of AD process of complex organic 
matter, i.e. greengrocery waste (carrot waste); 
• investigate the TS effect on methane production; 
• propose a new mathematical modelling approach to describe the effect of TS on the 
disintegration step of AD by using a new version of ADM1 model proposed by Esposito et al. 
(2008, 2011a, b). 
• determine the surface based kinetic constant for the cited selected substrate, using the model 
proposed by Esposito et al. (2008).

COMPLEX ORGANIC SUBSTRATES 
2.2. Materials and Methods 
2.2.1 Digester set-up and analytical measurements 
Biomethanation Tests (BMTs) were performed on a small scale under controlled and reproducible 
conditions in a 1000 mL glass bottle GL 45 (Schott Duran, Germany). Small amounts of Na2CO3 
powder were also added to control pH value. Each bottle was sealed with a 5 mm silicone disc that 
was held tightly to the bottle head by a plastic screw cap punched in the middle (Schott Duran, 
Germany). All digesters were immersed up to half of their height in hot water kept at a constant 
temperature of 308.15 K by 200 W A-763 submersible heaters (Hagen, Germany). Once a day, each 
digester was connected by a capillary tube to an inverted 1000 mL glass bottle containing an alkaline 
solution (2% NaOH). The inverted 1000 mL glass bottle was sealed in the same way as the digesters. 
To enable gas transfer through the two connected bottles, the capillary tube was equipped on both 
ends with a needle sharp enough to pierce the silicone disc. The weight, TS and VS concentration of 
the anaerobic sludge as well as the dry matter, moisture organic matter and ash content of substrate 
were determined according to Standard Methods (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 1998). Temperature and pH 
of all mixtures investigated were monitored for at least once a day with a TFK 325 thermometer 
(WTW, Germany) and a pH meter (Carlo Erba, Italy), respectively (Esposito et al.  2012a). 
 
2.2.2 Preliminary tests: Drying procedure 
In order to evaluate the effect of different moisture contents during AD, experiments at different TS 
contents are necessary. With the objective to evaluate only the effect of moisture content, these 
experiments must be conducted using the same inoculum, at the same operational conditions, varying 
only the TS content. Therefore fresh digestate was collected from a mesophilic AD of a buffalo farm 
and stored in 10 L buckets at 4°C and used as inoculum source. The initial inoculum characteristics in 
terms of TS, VS, carbohydrates fraction (Ch), proteins fraction (Pr) and lipids fraction (Li) are shown 
in Table 1.

The inoculum was dried by testing three different procedures: overnight drying of fresh digestate at 
50°C until constant weight, centrifugation with 6000 rpm, 10 min and membrane filtration with a 
Kubota 203 microfiltration module. The selected drying procedures were aimed at removing water 
from inoculum, obtaining a final value of 4% TS.  
In order to evaluate the effects of different drying treatments, the concentrated inoculum was reported 
at the initial TS content of 2% adding distilled water and was compared with the untreated inoculum 
in terms of biomethane potential. The aim of these tests was to individuate the drying procedure that 
does not modify the inoculum characteristics in terms of biomass activity and methane production. 
Therefore the inoculum obtained from each adopted drying procedure was used to carry out BMTs. 
These experiments were performed using pasta and cheese with known carbohydrate, protein and lipid 
concentrations (Table 2). The choice of the substrates was aimed at balancing the quantity of 
carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in the digester influent. The selected substrate allows the 
development of all microbial species involved in degradation of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in 
order to evaluate the pre-treatment effect on all these species.

The methane production is expressed under standard conditions and takes into account the gas content 
variation in the headspace of the reactor. The calculated methane production accounts for the global 
methane production without the residual endogenous methane production measured with the blank 
assay, which represent the reactor filled only with digestate without substrate addition.

Figure 1. Cumulative methane production of different tests. 
 
Figure 1 shows the cumulative methane production obtained using the different inoculums resulting 
from the different drying procedures and the untreated inoculum. The Bio-methanation Potential 
(BMP) is the same for all tests, but only adopting the centrifugation it is possible to observe a similar 
trend as for the untreated digestate. These results indicate that all the tested methods are suitable 
drying procedures that do not change the inoculum characteristics. For the following experiments, 
centrifugation was selected as drying procedure because it gives the minimum alteration of the 
inoculum and it is the most simple and cheaper method to apply in the laboratory.  
 
2.2.3 Effect of particle size on AD 
Bio-methanation experiments were performed using as initial substrate a selected greengrocery waste, 
(i.e. carrot waste) as initial substrate with the chemical composition in terms of TS, VS and 
concentrations of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids reported in Table 3. This substrate was selected 
for modelling purposes, due to the ease to obtain a cylindrical shape (Fig. 2). That shape was obtained 
by using cylindrical steel tube with a selected diameter. For each particle the same diameter and 
height was imposed in order to obtain a ratio between area and mass equal to a particle with spherical 
	  shape. The tests were conducted using four diffe	  rent PS: 0.25 mm, 4 mm, 9 mm, 15 mm (Table 1	  47).

The selected ratio between organic matter and anaerobic sludge was 0.5 organic matter/anaerobic 
sludge (i.e. Food/Mass ratio (F/M)). The selected digestate was collected from a mesophilic AD of a 
farm treating buffalo manure. The mass composition adopted for all tests is described in Table 4. 
BMTs were operated in triplicate and a blank assay was also carried out. In total 15 BMTs were 
performed.

2.2.4 Effect of moisture content on AD  
BMTs were performed using carrot with a cylindrical shape and buffalo manure anaerobic digestate. 
A specific value of PS = 15 mm was selected in order to get the disintegration step as rate limiting 
step. 
The initial TS content of the fresh digestate was 2%, that was dried by operating centrifugation in 
order to obtain the desired moisture contents. A fixed substrate amount of substrate was defined and 
only the digestate volume was changed to obtain different moisture contents. All the tests were 
performed imposing a selected ratio between organic matter and anaerobic sludge of 0.5 organic 
matter/inoculum. All the tests were conducted in triplicate. A total of nine bottles were operated with 
three TS contents: 4.98%, 7.5%, 11.3%. The mixture composition of each BMT test is reported in 
Table 5. 
Nine further tests were conducted using only anaerobic sludge as substrate to estimate the volume of 
methane resulting from the fermentation of the organics contained in the anaerobic sludge. Totally 18 
tests were performed.

2.2.5 Mathematical model  
For better understanding the effect of TS and PS on the anaerobic degradation of complex organic 
substrates, the anaerobic co-digestion model for complex organic substrates proposed by Esposito et 
al. (2011a,b) was used. The model was calibrated with the experimental data of the batch experiments 
to estimate the kinetic constant of the surface based disintegration process, K -2 -1sbk (ML T ). The 
differential mass balance equations and the process kinetics and stoichiometry, described in detail in 
Esposito et al. (2011a,b), are based on the ADM1 approach.  
	  The disintegration kinetic is based on the surface	  -based kinetic expression proposed by Sanders et1 	  a9l.

COMPLEX ORGANIC SUBSTRATES 
(2000) and reformulated by Esposito et al. (2008, 2011a,b) by including a*, which characterize the 
disintegration process:

where: 
C = concentration of the complex organic substrate in the digester [ML-3]; 
A = disintegration surface area [L2]; 
M = complex organic substrate mass [M]. 
Assuming that all the organic solid particles have the same initial size and cylindrical shape with h = 
2R, that they are progressively and uniformly degraded, a* equation is given by the following 
equation:

where: 
A  = disintegration surface area of the organic solid particle i [L2i ]; 
Mi = mass of the organic solid particle i [M]; 
n = total number of organic solid particles [ad.]; 
δ = complex organic substrate density [ML-3]; 
R = organic solid particles radius [L], assumed to be time dependent according to the following 
expression proposed by Sanders et al. (2000): 
R R K t= 0 − sbk                         (4) δ
where: 
R0 = initial organic solid particle radius [L], specified as the initial condition for model 
application.

The a* coefficient is different than the one proposed by Esposito et al. (2011a,b) as the solid particle 
present cylindrical instead of spherical shape. 
Integration of the differential algebraic equations is performed using a multi-step solution algorithm 
based on the numerical differentiation formulas in the software tool MATLAB®. 
Model calibration and validation was also performed to estimate K  (ML-2T-1sbk ) constant, the surface 
constant of the surface-based disintegration process.  
Calibration was performed by comparing model results with experimental data of cumulative methane 
production for a selected particle size and define the unknown parameter by fitting experimental data 
with model results. 
The calibration and validation procedure proposed by Esposito et al. (2011a,b) was performed. A 
comparison between experimental data and model results was performed by applying the Root Mean 
Square Error (RMSE) (Esposito et al. 2012a,b; Janssen and Heuberger 1995). 
2.3. Results and discussions 
2.3.1 Effect of particle size on AD performance  
Figure 3 shows the cumulated methane production for the reactors operated at four different PS during 
the whole experiments. Each curve represents the average of three replicates. The results clearly show 
a different initial trend for the four curves indicating a cumulative methane production rate inversely 
proportional to the PS. The cumulative methane production rate was inversely proportional to the PS. 
The methane yield of all curves is in the range of 460(±30) mL/gVS. There are no large differences as 
all reactors were filled with the same substrate amount (Fig. 3).

Figure 3. Effect of PS on the cumulative methane production  
 
Figure 4 shows a logarithm relationship between PS and initial methane production rate for the 
substrate added, evaluated by dividing the specific net methane production by the number of days (3 
days) from the start of the experiment. The Figure 4 indicates a strong impact of the PS on the kinetic 
rates and individuates the disintegration process as the rate-limiting step for methane production. 
These results are consistent with the findings of previous studies (Hills and Nakano 1984; Sharma et 
al. 1988; Esposito et al. 2008, 2011a,b). Hills and Nakano, (1984) plotting the methane gas production 
relative to the parameter 1/ΦsDm (where Φs represent the sphericity of the particles and Dm the average 
particle diameter) found a linear correlation between these parameters. The similar correlation was 
implicitly considered in the model proposed by Esposito et al. (2008, 2011a).

2.3.2. Effect of TS content on AD performances  
Figure 5 shows the cumulated methane production for the reactors operated at 3 different TS contents 
during the whole experiments. Each curve represents the average of 3 replicates. Lag-phase and the 
initial methane production rate, resulted inversely proportional to the TS content. These results are 
consistent with previous studies performed by Lay et al. (1997a,b), who made batch tests in 
mesophilic digesters at different pH values by testing the effect of moisture content in the range of wet 
digestion. The final methane yield, measured at the end of each experiment can be assumed for all 
tests coincident and equal to the mean value of 450 mL/gVS with a standard deviation of 14.23 (Table 
6). This is apparently not in agreement with the findings of Abbassi-Guendouz et al. (2012), 
Fernández et al. (2008) and Dong et al. (2010), who found higher methane yields with lower TS in the 
range of dry and semidry AD. The difference is due to the different moisture content range 
investigated, as the present experiments were carried out in wet conditions. The conversion of acids to 
methane by methanogenic bacteria can thus be influenced by the lack of water (Lay et al. 1997b; 
Ghosh 1985) that can occur with higher TS content in the range of dry and semidry digestion 
(Abbassi-Guendouz et al. 2012; Fernández et al. 2008; Dong et al. 2010).

Abbassi-Guendouz et al. (2012) on AD of cardboard, Mora-Naranjo et al. (2004) for waste samples 
excavated from landfill and Pommier et al. (2007) for paper waste. The presented results confirm that 
the TS content, also in wet AD, has a strong effect on the kinetic rates. In particular, at lower TS, due 
to the increasing water content and better transport and mass transfer conditions, it seems to be 
plausible that the microorganisms are better sustained with soluble substrates (Mora-Naranjo et al. 
2004).

Model calibration was used to estimate the kinetic constant of the surface based disintegration 
process, K -2 -1sbk (M L T ). Calibration was performed by comparing model results with experimental 
measurements of methane production and adjusting the unknown parameters until the model results 
	  adequately fit the experimental observations. Th	  e measured data of experiment T1 (Table 7) w2e	   r4e

used, and a calibration procedure introduced by Esposito et al. (2011a,b) was applied. Using the 
previously calibrated Ksbk model, validation was performed by calculating RMSE for T2, T3 and T4 
experiments. 
The model calibration performed resulted in setting the kinetic constant Ksbk equal to 0.28 kg m-2s-1. 
Ksbk was the value that minimizes RMSE (Fig. 7), that show a single monotone reversal trend that 
proves the existence of one and only one solution to the specific optimization problem. 
In Figure 8A a good overlap between the simulated and model data is shown. A small shift between 
experimental data and model results was observed.

The mathematical model proposed by Esposito et al. (2008, 2011a,b) was calibrated to set different 
values of the kinetic disintegration constant K -1dis[T ] = Ksbk a*, for different TS contents. For a selected 
PS = 15 mm, the value of a* constant was 0.561 m2kg-1. The measured data of experiment (Table 4) 
were used, a calibration procedure introduced by Esposito et al. (2011a,b) was applied and RMSE for 
T5, T6 and T7 experiments were evaluated. 
The results (Fig. 12-14) show a good agreement between the simulated and experimental data; this

agreement is confirmed in Table 9, where the values of the Kdis constant, evaluated for different TS,

shows the capability of the model to simulate the AD process of substrates with different initial TS.

By considering the presence of a limiting step (i.e. disintegration process) the rate of the overall AD 
process can be modelled by one equation. If first order kinetics is assumed for the disintegration 
process, the methane production rate can be expressed by equation (6): 
d [CH ]4 = Kdis[C]                                                        (6) dt

In Table 10 the values of the disintegration constant, obtained with equation (7) and with the 
mathematical model proposed by Esposito et al. (2008, 2011a,b) are reported, showing a good 
agreement of the results of the two methods. This confirms that a simplified model (i.e. a one equation 
model) can approximate the results of a full model when a rate-limiting step of the biological process 
is clearly present. 
2.5 Conclusion 
This chapter focused on the effect of TS content and PS on anaerobic digestion of complex organic 
substrates. A linear correlation between initial methane production rate and TS content was 
individuated. An inverse correlation between the Particle Size and the specific methane production 
was found and also a linear relationship between 1/PS and initial methane production rate for the 
substrate added were found. These results underline a strong impact of the PS on the kinetic rates and 
	  individuating the disintegration process as the rat	  e-limiting step for methane production. The surfa3c	   e0-

based kinetic constant Ksbk for the disintegration equation of carrot waste was determined. Also the 
values of the disintegration constant for different TS content were assessed. Finally a simple equation 
correlating TS and the disintegration constant was proposed, that showed a good agreement with the 
results of new version of ADM1 of complex organic substrate proposed by Esposito et al. (2008, 
2011a,b).

WASTE 
 	  
3.1. Introduction 
The environmental challenges related to the global population growth and the global energy demand 
are continuously promoting research efforts to develop innovative technologies aimed at producing 
energy from non-conventional sources (Lay et al. 1997a, b; Mora-Naranjo et al. 2004; Pommier et al. 
2007; Bollon et al. 2013). The Kyoto Protocol imposed to the major EU industrial countries to reduce 
their total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 8% from the 1990 level by the end of  2012 (Kyoto, 
1997). To achieve this, the EU policies have set forward the task of supplying 5% of the European 
energy demands from Anaerobic Digestion (AD) biogas by the year 2020 (Kim and Oh 2011).  
AD is a biological process for degradation of organic substrates under anaerobic conditions (Esposito et 
al., 2012a; Esposito et al., 2008) Based on the TS of waste used in the process, three types of AD can 
be distinguished: dry AD, characterized by a TS above 15%, semi-dry AD with a TS ranging between 
15% and 10%, and wet digestion with a TS lower than 10% (Li et al., 2011; Liotta, 2014; Zeshan and 
Annachhatre, 2012). The dry and semi-dry systems most widely applied at industrial scale are Valorga, 
Dranco, Kompogas and Bekon (Reith et al., 2003), but further applications have also been tested at 
pilot and farm-scale (Lianhua et al. 2010; Mussoline 2012; Mussoline et al. 2013; Zhang and Zhang 
1999). 
The key parameter of the dry AD process is the water content, that is essential for the biological 
process as water promotes substrate hydrolysis and enables the transfer of process intermediates and 
nutrients to the bacteria (Bollon et al., 2013; De Baere et al., 2010; Lissens et al., 2001). Hence, the 
first aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of TS on the AD of Food Waste (FW) under 
mesophilic conditions in batch reactors. BMTs were performed to compare methane yield, methane 
production rate, COD, VS and TS degradation in wet, semi-dry and dry conditions. In particular, 
VFAs composition and concentrations were also investigated as a useful indicator of process stress 
and instability (Ahring et al. 1995). VFAs are also valuable products that can be used as carbon source 
in biological processes (Elefsiniotis et al. 2004). However, the role of these parameters on the process 
development remains still little studied. Therefore, the second aim and main novelty of this chapter is 
to assess the TS effect on VFAs production from FW, and the VFAs effect on the process evolution.

 3.2. Materials and Methods 
3.2.1 Experimental set-up  
BMTs were performed at laboratory scale under controlled and reproducible conditions (Esposito et 
al. 2012b; Esposito et al. 2011a, b; Esposito et al. 2012c) using 2000 mL glass bottles GL 45 (Schott 
Duran, Germany). Each bottle was sealed with a 5 mm silicone disc, held tightly to the bottle head by 
a plastic screw cap punched in the middle (Schott Duran, Germany). A plastic tube hermetically 
closed to the top was inserted in the plastic screw cap to permit sample withdrawing. All digesters 
were immersed up to half of their height in hot water kept at a constant temperature of 308.15 K by 
200 WA-763 submersible heaters (Hagen, Germany). Small amounts of Na2CO3 powder were also 
added to control the pH and alkalinity values (Esposito et al. 2012b,c) .

3.2.2. Substrate and inoculum preparation 
BMTs were conducted in triplicate using FW and Buffalo Manure (BM) anaerobic digestate as 
inoculum. The FW was prepared according to Valorgas report (Valorgas, 2012) as indicated in Table 
11.

Particles size smaller than 0.5 mm were obtained by grinding the FW substrate before starting the 
experimental tests. The BM digestate, sampled from a mesophilic anaerobic digester, was dehydrated 
by filtration to obtain a final TS content of 17.82%. BMTs were carried out in wet (TS = 4.52%), semi-
dry (TS= 12.87%) and dry (TS = 19.02%) conditions as indicted in Table 12. The different TS 
contents of the mixture were obtained by adding 500 g of inoculum, differently diluted with distilled 
water and varying the amount of the substrate calculated in order to keep the ratio between organic 
matter and anaerobic sludge equal to 1:2. Blank BMTs were also conducted on BM without addition of 
substrate to estimate, as a control, the volume of methane resulting from the fermentation of the 
inoculum. Table 12 gives the mixture composition of each BMTs and reports the BM and substrate

3.2.3. Analytical methods 
3.2.3.1 Methane production 
Volumetric methane production was measured once a day, by connecting each digester by a small 
pipe to an inverted 1000 mL glass bottle containing a strong alkaline solution (12% NaOH). The 
inverted 1000 mL glass bottle was sealed in the same way as the digesters. The adopted procedure is 
described in detail in the Chapter 2. 
  
 3.2.3.2 VFAs analysis 
VFAs concentration and speciation were monitored throughout the process. VFAs were analysed 
collecting 100 mg of digestate sampled from each reactor and diluted with ultrapure water. The 
samples were vigorously stirred for three minutes and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. VFAs were 
extracted from the supernatant by SPME prior to GC-MS injection following the procedure proposed 
by Ábalos et al. (2000). 50 µL of a 2,2 dimethyl butanoic acid solution was added as internal standard. 
85 µm polyacrilate coated fibers from SUPELCO were used for the extraction and analysed after 
thermal desorption by an Agilent 6850 GC coupled with a 5973 Network MSD detector.

The weight, TS and VS concentration of the anaerobic sludge were determined by gravimetry 
according to EPA Standard Method 1684 (U.S.E.P.A, 2001). Temperature of all mixtures investigated 
was monitored for at least once a day with a TFK 325 thermometer (WTW, Germany). COD was 
determined by the closed reflux method, followed by photometric determination according to APHA 
standard method 5220D (APHA, 1998) and by applying the method proposed Zu

 3.3. Results and Discussion  
3.3.1 Bio-methane production 
Results of BMTs are summarized in Figures 16-18. Figure 16 reports the specific cumulative methane 
production versus time in reactors operated with different TS content. Each curve represents the 
average of 3 replicates (max standard deviation = 4%). The specific cumulative methane production 
was obtained dividing the cumulative methane production of each test by the initial substrate-inoculum 
VS mixture. Figure 17 reports the final specific methane yield, measured at the end of each 
experiment, as a function of the TS content and subtracted of the respective blank production. Finally 
Figure 18 illustrates the initial methane production rate versus the TS content, evaluated by dividing 
the specific net methane production by the number of days (3 days) from the start of the experiment.  
A lower TS content favours both the cumulative methane production and the final methane yield. 
Such a result is consistent with previous findings (Abbassi-Guendouz et al. 2012; Fernández et al. 
2008; Le Hyaric et al. 2012; Li et al. 2011; Liotta et al. 2014) obtained using different biodegradable 
substrates (Table 13), and confirms that the conversion of acids to methane by methanogenic bacteria 
can be negatively influenced by the lack of water (Lay et al. 1997a; Lay et al. 1997b). It is worth 
noting that the initial methane production rate is linearly and negatively correlated with the TS 
percentage (Fig. 18), as already observed during the AD of other organic wastes more or less rapidly 
biodegradable: dehydrated sludge mixed with dry kitchen waste (Lay et al. 1997a), waste excavated 
from a sanitary landfill (Mora-Naranjo et al. 2004), paper waste (Pommier et al. 2007), cellulose (Le 
Hyaric et al. 2012) and cardboard (Abbassi-Guendouz et al. 2012). At lower TS concentration, due to 
	  the increasing water content and to the more fa	  vourable transport and mass transfer conditions3,	   7it

seems plausible that the microorganisms are better sustained with soluble substrates (Mora-Naranjo et 
al. 2004), so that the process takes place more rapidly.

3.3.2 VFAs production 
A deeper understanding of the TS effect on process development can be obtained by comparing the 
trend of daily methane production (Fig. 19) and the corresponding concentration and speciation of 
VFAs (Fig. 20). A first peak of methane production can be detected in all reactors on the second day 
(Fig. 19). This peak, most likely due to the degradation of fast biodegradable compounds, corresponds 
to the peak of Total Volatile Fatty Acids (TVFAs) related to acid accumulation at the start-up of the 
process (Fig. 20). This means that the methanization is the rate-limiting step at the beginning of the 
process.  
Once the methanization has begun, the rate-limiting step becomes the hydrolysis process, and the 
TVFAs concentration slowly decreases. Two more peaks of methane production can be observed on 
	  day 15 and day 36. This finding is in agreement 	  with Charles et al. 2009 and Dong et al. 2010 w3	  h9o	  	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 3 - EFFECT OF MOISTURE CONTENT ON ANAEROBIC DIGESTION OF FOOD 
WASTE 
found two peaks of methane production during anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal 
solid waste. Dong et al. 2010 correlated this finding to the inhibitory effect of an elevated H2 partial 
pressure on the acetoclastic methanogenesis. It is likely that the two peaks correspond to the 
degradation of easily and slowly biodegradable compounds contained in the FW. 
The maximum TVFAs concentration found in the case of 12.9% and 19.2% were respectively 127 
mmol/kg and 135 mmol/kg (Fig. 20): in these cases TVFAs concentrations exceed the threshold 
values reported by Karthikeyan and Visvanathan, 2012 over that a sensible reduction of process 
kinetics occurs. The same occurs for the concentration of acetic acid, which reaches values higher 
than 33 mmol/L. The lower specific methane yield detected at the higher TS content can be correlated 
to acid inhibition during the process, which is more important for TS 12.9% and 19.2%. Indeed, high 
TVFAs concentrations induce acidification of the medium, leading to the presence of TVFAs in their 
un-dissociated forms, which are more toxic for microorganisms (Amani et al. 2010). A lower water 
content in the fermenting mixture makes the TVFAs concentration higher due to a lack of solvent. 
Therefore, even if the amount of produced TVFAs is the same, their concentration in the reactor will 
be much higher in dry AD. 
It has to be stressed that because of the lack of the mixing device inside the reactor higher TS 
concentrations imply higher heterogeneities and possible accumulation of inhibitory compounds 
inside specific reactor zones is likely to occur. Furthermore, at the highest TS concentrations 
investigated, environmental conditions do not allow the growth of acetoclastic, methanogens or 
acetate-oxidizing bacteria because of too high VFA concentrations and too low pH values (Abbassi-
Guendouz et al. 2012). During the first stage (0-4 days), acetic acid accumulation occurs (Fig. 21a) 
because hydrolysis and acidogenesis take place and the easy biodegradable fraction of FW is 
converted to TVFAs. During the second stage (5-35 days), acetoclastic methanogens are in the 
exponential growth phase and the acetic acid consumption rate is higher than its generation rate (Dong 
et al. 2010). Therefore, hydrolysis and acidogenesis become the rate-limiting steps and the produced 
acids are consumed to produce methane (Dong et al. 2010).

Figure 20. Evolution of TVFAs concentration in AD of FW at different TS contents 
 
The maximum concentration of propionic acid (Fig. 21b) occurs sooner for lower TS concentrations 
(day 13) and later for higher TS concentrations (day 17). This accumulation, common also to formic 
acid (Fig. 21e), can be correlated to the limited transformation of propionate to other VFAs as pointed 
out also by Hanaki et al. 1994. Also butyrate and valeric acid isomers present higher values with 
higher TS (Fig. 21c and 21d), probably a consequence of the process instability occurring during the 
acid production, which determines the formation of isomeric compounds. About the propionic acid, 
although an accumulation (8-12 days) can also be seen for TS = 4.5% during days 7-12, in this case the 
concentration starts immediately to decrease and drops regularly to zero (Fig. 21b). Such behavior can 
be attributed to the fact that the concentration of propionate is directly related to that of acetate in the 
reactor and the lowest acetate accumulation occurs during test T1 (TS = 4.5%) (Fig. 21a). During tests 
T2 and T3 the concentration of acetate is twice higher and lasts for about 5 days longer. This leads to 
an accumulation of propionate that is contemporary to the accumulation of acetate. A long acetate and 
propionate accumulation is instead not present in the reactor with TS content of 4.5%. The

be attributed to the co-presence of alternative fermentation pathways, that yield to butyric acid 
accumulation. This pathway is alternative to the acetic fermentation and can have different process 
kinetics.

The Total COD concentration in the reactor at different initial TS concentrations was also investigated. 
As expected, the COD degradation decreased under all TS conditions. The COD values at the end of 
the experiment were higher for higher TS content as COD removal decreased from 74 ± 6% (TS = 
4.5%) to 62 ± 8% (TS = 12.9%), down to 56±7% (TS = 19.2%), confirming the slowdown of process 
kinetics taking place at higher TS content due to high VFA concentration (Figs. 20 and 21).

 3.4 Conclusions 
This chapter focused on the effect of the TS content on the anaerobic digestion of FW. The 
experimental results show a decrease of the specific final methane yield of 4.3% and 40.8% in semi-
dry and dry conditions, respectively, compared to wet conditions. A higher specific cumulative 
methane production rate and better process performance in terms of COD reduction were also 
achieved at lower TS content. A linear correlation between the initial methane production rate and the 
TS content was observed. High TVFA concentrations of 135 mmol/kg and 127 mmol/kg were found 
in dry and semidry conditions, respectively, resulting in a slowdown of process kinetics

Effect of moisture content on anaerobic digestion of rice straw.
CHAPTER 4- EFFECT OF MOISTURE CONTENT ON ANAEROBIC DIGESTION OF RICE 
STRAW 
 
 4.1 Introduction 
Rice straw is one of the most abundant residues and is a potential renewable source for energy 
generation. AD may offer a promising alternative to solve imminent rice straw disposal problems in 
rice production regions (Zhang and Zhang 1999). Different advantages are connected to the AD of 
rice straw. This substrate is a very common agricultural waste and the biogas production potential is 
appealing to both developed and developing countries (Mussoline et al. 2013). However, one of the 
main disadvantages is related to the ligno-cellulosic structure of rice straw that is well attested to be 
difficult to biologically degrade (Sambusiti, 2013). Rice straw as lignocellulosic material is thus 
mainly composed as follow: cellulose (37.4%), hemi-cellulose (44.9%), lignin (4.9%) and silicon ash 
(13%) (Hills and Robert 1981).  
Dry AD is well suited to handle lingo-cellulosic biomass and provides a reduction of problems 
encountered in liquid, such as floating and stratification of solids. Dry AD of rice straw received much 
attention due to the high TS content of rice straw, that requires less sludge addition and smaller 
reactor volumes and pre-treatment. However, such high solid contents involve several technical 
disadvantages in terms of transport, handling and mixing to those encountered in wet processes (De 
Baere et al. 2010). The key parameter of dry AD processes is the water content, that is essential for 
the biological organic waste conversion. Water promotes substrate hydrolysis and enables the transfer 
of process intermediates and nutrients to bacterial sites (Lay et al. 1997a,b; Mora-Naranjo et al. 2004; 
Pommier et al. 2007).  
The aim of this chapter is to investigate the effect of the moisture content relating the AD performance 
to the process parameters monitored during the rice straw degradation. More in detail, by varying the 
TS in the range of 4.85-23.41% TS, the final specific methane production yield, VS, COD, VFA and 
total and soluble phenols concentration were analysed. In particular, this chapter focuses on inhibition 
problems and final methane yield reduction that occurs at elevated TS concentrations caused by VFAs 
and high concentration of soluble phenolic compounds.

 4.2. Material Methods 
4.2.1 Experimental set-up  
During the biogas production, samples were taken from the reactor, where pH, COD, VFAs and 
phenols concentrations were monitored. BMT were performed on a small scale under controlled and 
reproducible conditions in a 2000 mL glass bottle GL 45 (Schott Duran, Germany). Each bottle was 
sealed with a 5 mm silicone disc that was held tightly to the bottle head by a plastic screw cap 
punched in the middle (Schott Duran, Germany). A plastic tube hermetically closed at the top was 
inserted in the plastic screw cap to permit sampling. All digesters were immersed up to half of their 
height in hot water kept at a constant temperature of 308 +/- 1 K by 200 WA-763 submersible heaters 
(Hagen, Germany). Small amounts of Na2CO3 powder were also added to the medium to control pH 
values (Esposito et al., 2012a,b). 
 
4.2.2. Substrate and inoculum preparation 
BMTs were performed using rice straw and the anaerobic digestate of BM. The value of particle size 
smaller than 0.5 mm was obtained by grinding the rice straw prior to starting experimental tests.  
The initial TS content of the fresh digestate was 10.88%, this high value is related to the nature of the 
digestate, that is an effluent of the dewatering system of a mesophilic Anaerobic Reactor. To increase 
the TS content, the digestate was dewatered by filtration to obtain a final TS content of 17.20%. Then, 
the sample was diluted with water to obtain the designed moisture content for batch tests with lower 
TS content (Table 14). A fixed amount of BM digestate equal to 500 g was defined for each batch test 
and only the amount of substrate was changed to obtain different moisture contents. All the tests were 
performed imposing a selected organic matter/inoculum ratio of 0.5 and conducted in triplicate. A 
total of nine bottles were operated with a final TS content of the mixture: 4.84%, 14.86%, 23.40%, 
which represents, respectively, wet, semi-dry and dry conditions. Table 14 gives the mixture 
composition of each BMT test. 
Nine further tests were conducted using only BM as the substrate to estimate the volume of methane 
	  resulting from the fermentation of the organics 	  contained in the anaerobic sludge. Totally 18 te4	  s7ts

4.2.3. Analytical methods 
4.2.3.1 Methane production, COD, TS, VS. 
Volumetric methane production was measured once a day, by connecting each digester by a capillary 
tube to an inverted 1000 mL glass bottle containing an alkaline solution (12% NaOH). The inverted 
1000 mL glass bottle was sealed in the same way as the digesters. To enable gas transfer through the 
two connected bottles, the capillary tube was equipped on both ends with a needle sharp enough to 
pierce the silicone disc. 
The weight, TS and VS concentration of the anaerobic sludge as well as the dry matter, moisture 
organic matter and ash content of the substrate were determined by gravimetry according to Standard 
Methods (APHA, 1998). Temperature of all mixtures investigated was monitored for at least once a 
day with a TFK 325 thermometer (WTW, Germany). COD was determined by the closed reflux 
method, followed by photometric determination using a WTW Photolab Spektral visible 
spectrophotometer	   according to the APHA standard method 5220D and by applying the method 
proposed by Zupančič and Roš (2012).	  
 
4.2.3.2 VFAs and phenols analysis 
VFAs concentration and speciation were monitored throughout the process. VFAs were analysed 
collecting 100 mg of digestate sampled from each reactor and diluted with ultrapure water. The 
	  samples were vigorously stirred for three minutes	   and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. VFAs w4e	   r8e

extracted from the supernatant by SPME prior to GC-MS injection following the procedure proposed 
by Ábalos et al. (2000). 50 µL of a 2,2 dimethyl butanoic acid solution were added as internal 
standard. 85 µm polyacrilate coated fibers from SUPELCO were used for the extraction and analysed 
after thermal desorption by an Agilent 6850 GC coupled with a 5973 Network MSD detector. 
Total Phenols determination is according to APHA standard method 5550 B (APHA, 1998), by the 
use of the Folin reagent. The method is sensitive for any compound containing aromatic hydroxyl 
group. The calibration curve was built preparing standards at increasing concentration of phenol 
(C6H5OH).  
 4.3. Results and Discussion  
4.3.1 Methane production 
Results of BMTs are summarized in Figures 22-24. Figure 22 reports the specific cumulative methane 
production versus time in reactors operated with different TS content. Each curve represents the 
average of 3 replicates (max standard deviation = 3%). The specific cumulative methane production 
was obtained dividing the cumulative methane production of each test by the initial substrate-inoculum 
VS mixture. Figure 23 reports the final specific methane yield, measured at the end of each 
experiment, as a function of the TS content and subtracted of the respective blank production.  
Figures 22-23 show that the lower TS content was favourable for improving the cumulative methane 
production and the final methane production yield.  
Figure 24 illustrates the daily methane production during the first 60 days. One initial peak of methane 
production was detected in all reactors. This peak is connected to the anaerobic degradation of 
biodegradable substrates, corresponding to the TVFA (Fig. 26) peak related to acid accumulation at 
the start-up of the process. This means that the hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step of the process. The 
results obtained with the final methane yield for different TS are consistent with previous studies 
operated with different types of substrate performed by Lay et al. (1997a, b), Abbassi-Guendouz et al. 
(2012), Fernández et al. (2008), Dong et al. (2010), Le Hyaric et al. (2012) and Shi et al. (2014). All 
authors do agree that higher methane yields can be obtained with a lower TS. Thus, the conversion of 
acids to methane by methanogenic bacteria might be influenced by the lack of the free water (Lay et 
	  al. 1997b; Ghosh 1985) that can occur with a h	   igher TS content in the range of dry and semid4	   r9y

digestion (Abbassi-Guendouz et al. 2012; Fernández et al. 2008; Li et al. 2011). Figure 25 indicates a 
non-linear relationship between TS content and initial methane production rate. This behaviour is not 
in agreement with several author findings, who found a linear relationship between the two parameters 
(Lay et al. 1997b; Le Hyaric et al. 2012; Abbassi-Guendouz et al. 2012; Mora-Naranjo et al. 2004; 
Pommier et al. 2007). The different behaviour can be explained because of the different substrate 
composition, the complex nature of lingo-cellulosic compounds, the low bio-availability of cellulose, 
the substrate crystalline structure and the presence of hemicellulose.

4.3.2 Analysis of process intermediates 
To explain the obtained results it was monitored the concentration of VFAs, that is considered an 
useful indicator of process stress and instability (Ahring et al. 1995). Figure 26 illustrates the temporal 
evolution of selected VFAs (acetate, butyrate, propionate, valerate and formic acid) for the three TS 
concentrations investigated. The lower methane yield detected with a higher TS content corresponded 
to an higher concentration of acids. The highest concentrations were observed at TS = 23.41%, with 
maximum values of 8.73 mmol acetic acid/kg on the 2nd day, 9.52 mmol formic acid/kg on the 8th day, 
19.18 mg propionic acid/kg on the 2nd day and 2.02 mmol butyric acid/kg on the 8th day were found. 
In the case of TS = 14.86%, the maximum values of 5.16 mmol acetic acid/kg on the 8th day, 2.57 
mmol formic acid/kg on the 8th day, 6.82 mg propionic acid/kg on the 8th day and 0.43 mmol butyric 
	  acid/kg on the 9
th day were found. For a TS co	  ntent of 4.85% the maximum values of 2.56 mm5	   o1l	  	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 4- EFFECT OF MOISTURE CONTENT ON ANAEROBIC DIGESTION OF RICE 
STRAW 
 
acetic acid/kg on the 3rd day, 0.4 mmol formic acid/kg on the 1st day, 1.57 mmol propionic acid/kg on 
the 8th day and 0.21 mmol butyric acid/kg on the 3rd day were found. 
An insufficient amount of methanogenic archaea may be the cause of such high concentrations of 
VFAs. Indeed, high VFA concentrations induce acidification of the medium, and result in the 
presence of VFAs in their un-dissociated form which is more toxic for microorganisms (Amani et al. 
2010). Furthermore, at the highest TS concentrations, environmental conditions did not allow the 
growth of acetoclastic methanogens or acetate-oxidizing bacteria on account of high VFA 
concentrations and low pH values (Abbassi-Guendouz et al. 2012). Also during the first days, acid 
accumulation occurred (Fig. 27a-e), because the hydrolysis and acidogenesis took place and the easy 
biodegradable fraction of rice straw was converted to VFAs. During the second stage, acetoclastic 
methanogens where in the exponential growth phase and the acetic acid consumption rate exceeded its 
generation rate, also if the hydrolysis and acidogenesis were still going on. In the final stage, the 
balance between the hydrodysis/acidogenesis and methanogenesis was formed and the produced acids 
were consumed to produce methane (Dong et al. 2010). 
Is finally possible to notice how the accumulation of butyric and formic acids takes place only in the 
dry and semidry reactors and lasts until the 8th day, while both this acids concentrations are close to 
zero during almost the whole experiment. This might be attributed to the co-presence of an alternative 
fermentation pathway, that brings to the formation of butyric acid. This pathway is alternative to the 
acetic fermentation and determine different process kinetics. This indicates that in the studied reactors 
the border conditions are different for the fermenting microorganisms, probably originating bacterial 
growths with different distributions and degradation pathways.

3 mmol/kg, 15 mmol/kg and 33 mmol/kg, respectively, i.e. much lower respect to the threshold value 
indicated by Karthikeyan and Visvanathan, 2012. It was therefore supposed that the inhibition 
occurred because of higher total phenols content at higher TS concentration (Fig. 28).

 4.4 Comparative process efficiency  
The reactor performances are reported for all TS concentrations in terms of VS reduction, evolution of 
COD removal and specific final methane production yield. In terms of VS removal efficiency, the 
better performances were observed at a lower TS content. This finding is in agreement with the 
measured final methane production yield.  
The COD values at the end of the experiment were higher for higher TS content as COD removal 
decreased from 63 ± 6% (TS = 4.85%) to 59 ± 8% (TS = 14.86%), down to 48 ± 7% (TS = 23.4%), 
confirming the slowdown of process kinetics taking place at higher TS content due to high VFA 
concentration. 
 
 4.5. Conclusions 
This chapter focuses on the effect of the moisture content on the anaerobic digestion of rice straw. A 
higher specific methane production yield and process performance in terms of VS and COD 
reductions were achieved at a lower TS content. This suggests that a wet anaerobic digestion gives

better performances compared with dry processes. An inhibition correlated to the TVFA accumulation 
was found at higher TS content. In fact maximum TVFA concentration of 2.1 g/kg was found in dry 
condition, 1 g/kg in semidry conditions and 0.2 g/kg in wet conditions. Higher total phenol 
concentration was also found at higher TS content. This could determine inhibition phenomena and 
reduction of methane production.

CHAPTER 5 - ADM1 FOR DRY AND SEMI-DRY ANAEROBIC DIGESTION OF SOLID 
ORGANIC WASTE 
5.1 Introduction 
Experimental research carried out in recent years on AD have definitely established that the TS content 
plays an important role on process development (Dong et al. 2010; Brown and Yebo 2013; Fernàndez 
et al. 2008; Forster-Carneiro et al. 2007; Forster-Carneiro et al. 2008; Le Hyaric et al. 2012; Lü et al. 
2012; Jha et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013; Xu and Li 2012; Liotta et al. 2014; Shi et al. 2014; Zhu et al. 
2014). As a consequence, several studies have been lead recently to adapt and calibrate the existing 
mathematical models to take into account the effect of the TS content (Lay et al. 1997a, 1997b; Fdez-
Güelfo et al. 2012; Brown et al. 2012; Le Hyaric et al. 2012; Motte et al. 2013). Le Hyaric et al. (2012) 
and Lay et al. (1997a, 1997b) applying the Gompertz model to simulate the results of Specific 
Methanogenic Activity test, found that a high TS content (15%-25%) reduces substrate degradation 
because of water and nutrients limitation, resulting in a lower methanogenic activity. Brown et al. 
(2012) used the first-order kinetic models to characterize the methane production of lignocellulosic 
biomass and found a linear relationship between logarithmic methane production and reaction time in 
both in wet and dry anaerobic digestion of switchgrass, corn stover, wheat straw, leaves, yard waste 
and maple. Dry anaerobic digestion generally exhibits a poor start-up performance, thus several models 
assume the hydrolysis as the rate-limiting step of the process (Jha et al. 2013). In particular, Abbassi-
Guendouz et al. (2012), applying the ADM1 (Batstone et al. 2002) to cardboard treatment, found a 
decreasing first-order hydrolysis rate constant for carbohydrates degradation when increasing the TS 
content between 15-30%. Liotta et al. (2014) also found a decreasing disintegration rate when 
increasing the TS content in the range of wet digestion. Bollon et al. (2011) found a similar result using 
municipal solid waste digestate.  
Moreover recent studies demonstrated the important role of the mechanisms associated to VFAs uptake 
on process performances (Ward et al., 2008, Bolzonella et al., 2003, Dai et al., 2013, Jha et al., 2013, 
Pohl et al., 2013). As intermediate products, VFAs have been treated as an indicator of the digestion 
efficiency, but high concentrations of VFAs can determine a decrease of pH leading to performance 
failure of the digester (Gerardi, 2003, Jha et al., 2013, Motte et al., 2013, Vavilin et al., 1996a). 
An attempt to model dry anaerobic digestion considering also the role of VFA uptake was done by 
Guendouz et al. (2010), who found a transitory accumulation of VFA during the batch tests indicating 
that not only the hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step during dry anaerobic digestion of the solid wastes. 
Motte et al. (2013) proposed a quadratic model able to descript dynamically the effect of TS, PS and 
s	   ubstrate/inoculum ratio on methane production	  , pH and VFA concentration. The model resu5l	  t8ed

highly significant (p-value < 0.05) and the coefficient of determination reach also 80%, however the 
authors have not implemented a complete model, like ADM1, and have not calibrated any kinetic 
constant varying TS content.  
The aim of the present chapter is to develop a kinetic model that can specifically characterize the 
disintegration, the acetogenesis and methanogenis steps of selected complex organic substrates as a 
function of TS content in order to obtain a model able to predict and interpret results from anaerobic 
digesters in wet, semi-dry and dry AD. In the following section, an overview of the model structure, 
assumptions and main model parameters is presented. The proposed model is based on the cited ADM1 
model (Batstone et al., 2002) as modified by Esposito et al. (2008, 2011a,b, 2012a,b) for complex 
organic substrates (modified ADM1). The kinetic equations are reformulated to consider the direct 
effect of TS content and the effect of the intermediate compounds, which can affect, as a function of 
the TS content, the whole process development. The dynamics of acetate, propionate and methane 
production presented in Chapter 3 and 4 and obtained from two different series of batch anaerobic 
digestion of food waste and rice straw were used to calibrate the proposed model. Food waste was 
selected as representative of easily, highly biodegradable and heterogeneous substrates (Zhang et al. 
2007), while rice straw as representative of slowly biodegradable and model of lignocellulosic residues.  
 
5.2 Model description 
The proposed model is based on the Modified ADM1 (MADM1), extended to take into account the 
presence of complex organic substrates in the feedstock, and the operation of the digester in semi-dry 
and dry conditions. It is applied for Completely Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) and batch systems. The 
MADM1 is a structured biological model that simulates the major conversion mechanisms of organic 
substrates into biogas and the degradation of by-products. It assumes that composite materials are 
converted into carbohydrates, proteins and lipids by a disintegration step (Esposito et al. 2012a,b). 
These components are further hydrolysed into simple sugars, amino acids and long chain fatty acids. 
Then, during the acidogenic step, fermentative micro-organisms convert these products into acetic, 
propionic, butyric and valeric acids, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The uptake of fatty acids yields 
acetate (acetogenic step), which is converted into methane by methanogens.  
The disintegration and hydrolysis steps are modelled by first-order kinetics. The disintegration used 
	  surface based kinetic, while hydrolysis step 	   a classical first order kinetic. All the oth5e	   r9

transformations are classical biochemical transformations performed by specific bacterial groups, and 
are described by a Monod-type equation, where the substrate uptake is associated to the microbial 
growth. The kinetics of microbial growth and decay are also included in the model. 
The overall model consists of 28 mass balance equations (Batstone et al. 2002) applied to the 28 state 
variables (13 substrates and 15 biomasses) summarized in Tables 15-16. The kinetic constants and 
processes of the modelled substrates in the MADM1 are listed in Table 17. It is worth noting that, 
according to the MADM1, only the parameter Ksbk, not included in the original version of the ADM1, 
is function of the substrate intrinsic characteristics and therefore depends also on the TS content of 
the substrate (Liotta et al. 2014).

With respect to the MADM1, the proposed model modifies some of the kinetic equations listed in 
Esposito et al. (2011a,b). Each kinetic constant (Ksbk, Kac and Kpro) is expressed as function of the TS 
content in order to take into account the reduction of intermediate process kinetic on the following 
processes: the initial substrate disintegration, the acetate and the propionate up-take. More precisely 
assuming CSTR conditions and a constant reactor Volume (V), for each state variable (Ci), the mass 
balance has the following form: 
     dCi qC= i−in qC− i−outdt V V +∑ ν ρ         (8) j=i−23 ij j
w	   here: 	   6	   2	  	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 5 - ADM1 FOR DRY AND SEMI-DRY ANAEROBIC DIGESTION OF SOLID 
ORGANIC WASTE 
the term  qCi−in qC− i−outV V  = 0 in batch conditions, where the flow rate (q) is assumed to be zero, and 
the term∑ ν ijρ j is the overall reaction term expressed as a sum of specific kinetic rate for the j=i−23
process j (ρj) multiplied by the stoichiometric coefficients (νij) that describe the influence of the 
specific process j on the individual component i.  
The specific kinetic rates and the stoichiometric coefficients used in the present model are strictly 
equivalent to those present in the MADM1. 
The main difference of the proposed model compared to the MADM1 is the capability to consider the 
variation of the kinetic constants Ksbk, Kac and Kpro with the TS content. These constants are involved 
in the following specific kinetic rates:  
      ρi,1 = Ksbk ⋅C ⋅a*       (9) 
     Sρ = K ⋅ proi,13 pro K S ⋅Xpro ⋅ I+ 2     (10) s bu
     Sρ aci,14 = Kac ⋅ K S ⋅Xac ⋅ I3     (11) s + ac
These equations have been reformulated by substituting the kinetic constants Ksbk, Kac and Kpro with 
the following functions:  
     Ksbk (TS) = a ⋅TS + b             (12) 
             Kac,pro(TS) = c ⋅TS + d           (13) 
where the new parameters a, b, c and d need to be calibrated depending on the substrate type (in this 
study rice straw and food waste) and the specific experimental conditions such as temperature, 
pressure, pH, retention time and mixing conditions (Liotta et al. 2014). 
 
5.3 Model calibration 
The proposed model was calibrated using the experimental data obtained during anaerobic digestion 
of food waste and rice straw. The experimental tests were conducted in batch, at 32°C, using two liter 
r	  eactors. The following TS concentrations were t	  ested 4.2%, 12.8% and 19.2% for the food wast6e	   3, 	  	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 5 - ADM1 FOR DRY AND SEMI-DRY ANAEROBIC DIGESTION OF SOLID 
ORGANIC WASTE 
and 4.85%, 14.86% and 23.40% for the rice straw. The experimental procedures and the obtained 
results are reported in Chapters 3-4. 
The calibration was performed in two steps. In the first step, the simulated curves were plotted for 
each value of K  ac, Kpro and Ksbk, and the simulated results were compared with experimental data by 
applying the RMSE method, as usually done for the model calibration process (Janssen and 
Heuberger 1995; Esposito et al. 2011a, b). In the second step, the values of each K  ac, Kpro, Ksbk 
associated to the lower RMSE that better fit the proposed equations (12, 13), were introduced in the 
model to perform a second set of simulations. These modelling results were again compared with 
experimental data by individuating the final RMSE values for each K  ac, Kpro and Ksbk value. The final 
results of calibration procedure are summarized in Figures 29-31 and Table 18. In particular the 
experimental data were used for both substrates to calibrate the disintegration kinetic constants Kdis of 
the ADM1, assuming it coincides with the constant Ksbk of the MADM1, as the specific surface did 
not varied in the different tests. Acetic and propionic acid productions were used to calibrate the 
constants Kac and Kpro. All the other constants and parameters were set from literature data (Batstone 
et al. 2002; Esposito et al. 2008, 2011a, b).

5.4. Results and discussion 
Table 18 and Figure 32 show that for both substrates the calibrated disintegration rate constant 
linearly decreased with increasing TS concentration for both substrates. The linear function (12) can 
be expressed in this case as follow:  
For food waste: Kdis = −0.31⋅TS + 7.9  with r2 = 0.99    (14) 
For rice straw: Kdis = −0.1⋅TS + 2.9     with r2 = 0.97               (15) 
Where Kdis is assumed to be coincident with Ksbk.  
The values of parameters a, b are different for the two tested substrates because of the specific 
characteristic of the initial substrate to be hydrolysed. In fact food waste is a more easily 
biodegradable substrate compared to rice straw that is a complex lignocellulosic structure more 
difficult to be disintegrated. In fact, the structure of rice straw consists of different types of polymers 
that are difficult to degrade such as: cellulose (37.4%), hemi-cellulose (44.9%), lignin (4.9%) and 
silicon ash (13%) (Hills and Robert 1981; Mussoline et al. 2013). Thus for each TS the rice straw 
disintegration rate constant (and the values a, b) are lower than the one of food waste. These results 
are consistent with results previously presented by Liotta et al. (2014), where a linear correlation with 
r2 = 0.99 was found between the carrot waste disintegration rate constant and TS in the range of wet 
conditions.

The linear correlations (14, 15) describe the slowing-down of the disintegration process with higher 
values of the TS content caused by the lack of water and the limited transfer of hydrolysis products 
(and other intermediates) to bacterial sites (Lay et al. 1997a, 1997b; Mora-Naranjo et al. 2004; 
Pommier et al. 2007). This is in agreement with results presented by Abbassi Guendouz et al. (2012), 
Pommier et al. (2007) and Liotta et al. (2014), who observed a strong impact of the TS content on 
biodegradation kinetic rates and maximum methane production in anaerobic digestion of different 
substrates.  
Figure 33 shows that for both substrates, a linear and inverse correlation exist between the values of 
the propionate and acetate kinetic constants and the TS content. In this case, a unique linear function, 
as reported in (13), can be expressed for acetate and propionate as follows:  
For food waste: Kac/pro = −0.41⋅TS +10.35  with r2  > 0.99   (16) 
For rice straw:  K = −0.28 ⋅TS +10.71 with r2 ac/pro > 0.97   (17) 
The values of parameters b, c in equation (16, 17) are the same for acetate and propionate. This 
means that the kinetic rate constants for acetate and propionate are equal for each TS content. Thus, it 
can be concluded that the effect of the water content on propionate and acetate up-take is equal.  
Also in this case the parameters c, d differ on the base initial substrate type because of different 
experimental conditions and biomass involved in the anaerobic degradation of food waste and rice 
straw. Additionally there are larger differences between the values of Kac/pro for rice straw and food 
waste with higher TS. Thus, the intrinsic characteristics of the substrate type are more influent on the 
process development and biomass selection with a lack of water.  
This study show that with a higher TS content lower values of Kac/pro are obtained, that determine 
higher concentrations of acetate and propionate during the whole process (Figures 30-31). This means 
that a higher TS content can lead to process inhibition due to VFA accumulation, implying lower 
process efficiency in terms of VS degradation, final methane yield and specific methane production 
rate. Indeed,  Figures 30-31 show a lower level of inhibition for the experiments under wet digestion 
conditions (TS = 4.52% for the food waste and TS = 4.85% for the rice straw), compared to the 
experiments under semi-dry (TS = 12.87% and TS = 14.86%) or dry (TS = 19.2% and TS = 23.4%) 
anaerobic conditions. This is probably due to a reduction of the water content that implies a lower 
nutrient content in the media and TVFAs accumulation.  
Despite the good fitting between simulated and experimental concentrations, showing the capability 
of the model to simulate the AD process of the two substrates with different initial TS, it is wor6th9

noting that the model fitting is of higher quality for the data obtained during rice straw digestion. For 
food waste, Figures 31,e and 31, i show that some points could not be fitted by the simulated curves. 
This means that an inhibition phenomenon, related to the difficult degradation of propionic acid and 
consequent formation of propionate isomers during the process not taken into account in the 
simulation, should be considered in the further development of the kinetic equations of the model. 
This different behaviour can be related to the nature of the substrate type. Food waste is of complex 
nature and contains many different compounds that have different degradation kinetics. In contrast, a 
unique substrate like rice straw, presents a kinetic behaviour easier to be modelled.

6.1 Mathematical modelling of aerobic plug flow reactor and non-ideal flow reactor 
6.1.1 Introduction 
Mathematical modelling and dynamic simulation have become important tools for design and 
operation of wastewater and solid waste treatment plants. However, semi-empiric methods and 
mathematical models based on ideal assumptions are still used for routine reactor design and 
operation. For instance, biochemical models for the evaluation of the bioconversion processes 
prevailing in CSTR, such as the IAWPRC Activated Sludge Model (ASM1) (Henze et al. 1987) and 
modelling tools to evaluate system design and upgrade options, such as the ATV models (ATV 1991; 
Benedetti et al. 2008) are widely applied. However, these models do not include the hydrodynamics of 
the bioreactor. This is a limitation for the model suitability as many authors claim that the efficiency of 
the pollution removal process depends also on the reactor hydrodynamics (Levin and Gealt 1993; Le 
Moullec et al. 2008; Makinia and Wells 1999).  
Several authors in the presented models couple the hydrodynamic processes with biochemical 
processes and consider in the model the effect of one process on another. In particular the biochemical 
process can be affected by the reactor flow conditions because the biomass, substrates and inhibiting 
compounds can be distributed in different reactor zones. This implies that the biochemical process can 
occur with different kinetics depending on hydrodynamic condition. Inhibition could also happen due 
to the accumulation of some inhibitory compounds in specific reactor zones. In parallel, the biomass 
type developing in the reactor influences the viscosity of the mixed liquor and thus the hydrodynamics 
of the reactor. The objective of this literature review is, therefore, to review mathematical models of 
aerobic reactors going beyond the hypothesis of complete mixing conditions and focusing only on 
hydrodynamic aspects and on the role of reactor configuration on the process performances. The 
present research also analyses and compares performance-prediction models referring to the most 
common aerobic bioreactors configurations, i.e. Activated Sludge Reactors (AS), Fluidized Bed 
Reactors (FBR), Biofilters (BF) and Trickling Filters (TF), and addresses both plug flow reactors and 
non-ideal flow reactors. Finally, the chapter illustrates more in details the differences among the 
proposed approaches, indicates the adopted solving algorithms and discusses the capacity of the 
models to fit the experimental data.

6.1.2. Design models and performance-prediction models 
A design model is a model capable of predicting the reactor volume when the desired treatment 
efficiency and the operational conditions are set. It is typically based on simplified assumptions 
aiming to make the model easy to apply. For instance, steady-state instead of dynamic conditions are 
assumed. In the literature, there are few attempts to use steady-state mathematical models to design 
PFR and non-ideal flow reactors (San 1994) (Table 19). They are often simply modelled in terms of 
design graph or charts (San 1994). These steady-state models are however beyond the scope of this 
chapter. In contrast, a performance-prediction model is typically a dynamic model that simulates most 
of the physical, chemical and biological processes taking place in the reactor. It is aiming to predict 
the effluent concentrations once the bioreactor volume is known and the operational conditions are 
set. Table 20 gives some performance-prediction models published in the literature. They are 
reviewed in details in this chapter, after a short description of the fundamentals of the adopted 
approaches. The attempts made by the authors to calibrate or validate these models are described as 
well.

6.1.3 Modeling approaches 
Hydrodynamic models can be generally divided into two different groups: ideal models, referring to 
CSTR and PFR conditions, and non ideal models, taking into account the effect of longitudinal 
mixing neglected by ideal models (Table 21). In the CSTR model, the inlet reactant is assumed to be 
completely mixed in the reactor so that concentrations are homogeneous in the vessel. 
The mass-balance equation for a non-reactive tracer in a CSTR is: 
  dCex V =Q ⋅Cin −Q ⋅Cex                                                                     (18) dt
where:  
t = time [T]; 
V = reactor control volume [L3]; 
Q = volumetric flow rate [L3T-1]; 
C = reactant concentration [ML-3]; 
in = subscript denoting influent;  
ex = subscript denoting effluent;  
In the PFR, it is assumed that no longitudinal mixing occurs between adjacent elements of the fluid 
and each element of the influent reactant remains in the reactor for a time equal to the hydraulic 
retention time (HRT).  
The mass-balance for a non-reactive tracer is: 
 ∂C dV =Q C Q ⎛C ∂C⋅ − ⋅⎜ + dx ⎞⎟                                                                     (19)  
∂t ⎝ ∂x ⎠
where: 
x = spatial variable in the flow direction [L]. 
Under un-steady state conditions, equation (11) may be written as: 
  ∂C v ∂C= − ⋅                                                                               (20) 
∂t ∂x
where: 
v = flow velocity [LT-1]. 
Among non-ideal models, a prominent role is played by the tank-in-series (TIS) model. This model is 
used to describe the dispersion in PFR. The TIS model describes the flow in a reactor system 
	  considering it can be discretized into a series o	   f equal-sized hypothetical CSTRs. This model7i	  n6g

approach was introduced for tracer analyses and one of the earliest descriptions of this theory was 
given by MacMullin and Weber (1935).  
If a tracer is distributed uniformly throughout all the compartments of the vessel and then diluted out 
at a constant rate, the effluent tracer concentration Cex as a function of time is given by (Martin, 2000):  
C NN t N−1 N⎛ ⎞ − tex = ⎜ ⎟ e τ                                                              (21) 
Cin (N −1) !⎝τ ⎠
where: 
N = number of reactor in series.  
Levenspiel (1972) related the number of reactors in series to the variance number with the following 
expression: 
 2 1σ =                                                                                    (22) 
N
where: 
σ2 = variance of Residence Time Distribution (RTD) curve from a pulse tracer input.  
Generally, N = 1 represents a CSTR, whereas N = ∞ means a PFR. 
With respect to the previous approach, the extended tank-in series model (ETIS) (Murphy and 
Timpany 1967) presents a small difference, as it introduces the concept of non-integer number of 
hypothetical tanks in series to remove the quantization problem which occurs as N tends to 1. The 
ETIS model defines the exit age distribution function, E(t), through the following equations: 
C NN t N −1 N⎛ ⎞ − t E(t)= ex = ⎜ ⎟ e τ                                                      (23)  
Cin Γ(N )⎝τ ⎠

0
Consequently, the N parameter loses its physical meaning as a number (positive) of tanks in the ETIS 
model, but the model acquires a continuous distribution of flow-rate. The ETIS model coincides with 
the TIS model when the parameter N is an integer number. This model is particularly useful when N is 
small and a large number of discontinuities occurs in the TIS model due to the discrete nature of the 
parameter N. A further variation of the TIS model consists in fractionating the reactor in different 
sections, e.g. a CSTR section, a PFR section and a dead section with by-pass flows or back-mixing 
flows between the zones. With tracer tests and considering different liquid and gas flow rates, it is 
possible to define the values of bypass flows and dead sections.

CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
Apart from the TIS and TIS-derived models, other approaches have been followed to describe the 
dispersion effect. One of the pioneering and most complete studies on longitudinal mixing in aeration 
tanks was published by Thomas and McKee (1944). They demonstrated that longitudinal mixing is 
the effect of various factors as the degree of turbulence, the flow rate, the length of the tank and the 
number of baffles. The authors set up the dispersion model introducing the differential equation for a 
tubular reactor with longitudinal diffusion as well as flow (changes in volume were assumed not to 
occur, so that the mean longitudinal velocity is the same at all cross-sections). The resulting equation 
is: 
∂C D ∂
2C ∂C
= 2 − v                                                                             (25) ∂t ∂x ∂x
where: 
D = dispersion number [L2T-1].  
Equation (17) was solved considering as initial boundary conditions that the concentration gradient 
was equal to the initial concentration and by assuming that the exit gradient was equal to zero at the 
end of the reactor.  
The authors calculated the dispersion coefficient as:  
 D = L2 1802           (26) π ⋅ t90
where: 
L = reactor length [L]; 
t90 = time required for the effluent concentration to attain 90% of its ultimate value [T].  
The dispersion number, D is defined as: 
  D D=                                                                                              (27) 
v ⋅ L
D has an important role to indicate which of the ideal flow models is approached. When D is higher 
than 0.5-4, completely mixing can be assumed (Khudenko and Shpirt 1986; U.S. EPA 1993; Makinia 
and Wells 1999). Long and narrow tanks, with a dispersion number lower than 0.05-0.2 (Khudenko 
and Shpirt 1986; U.S. EPA 1993; Eckenfelder et al. 1985; Makinia and Wells 1999) are considered an 
approximation of plug flow. Typical dispersion numbers in wastewater treatment units are in the range 
between 0.1 and 4, which suggests that the existing deviations from ideal flow have to be taken into 
consideration (Makinia and Wells 2005; Makinia and Wells 1999).

6.1.4.Mathematical modeling of Activated Sludge plug flow reactors 
6.1.4.1 Process description 
The activated sludge process is used for the biological treatment of municipal and industrial 
wastewaters. The basic activated sludge treatment process (Fig. 34A) consists of the following three 
	  components: i) a flocculant slurry of mixed liquo	  r suspended solids (MLSS) utilized in the bioreac7	  to9r

to remove soluble and particulate organic matter from the influent waste stream; ii) a sedimentation 
tank to separate the MLSS from the treated water and iii) a recycle system to return solids removed 
from the liquid-solids separation unit back to the bioreactor.  
The MLSS containing bioreactor is commonly called an aeration basin. It is an open tank equipped 
with a system to transfer oxygen into solution to provide mixing energy to guarantee suspension of the 
MLSS. Models taking into account the hydrodynamics of the plug flow aeration basin, that could 
affect key parameters of the process such as treatment efficiency or settling properties of the activated 
sludge, are described below. 
 
6.1.5. Model development 
6.1.5.1 Ideal PFR and CSTR in series 
The ideal plug-flow model has been frequently applied to plug flow activated sludge systems (Fig. 
34B). Lawrence and McCarty (1970), assuming steady-state conditions, proposed the following 
equation for processes that occur in the aeration basin based on the hypothesis of constant biomass 
concentration in the reactor, valid as long as the SRT/HRT ratio is higher than 5: 
dC C ⋅ X
= −µ ⋅                                                                                                   (28) 
dt ks +C
X  = time averaged biomass concentration [ML-3]; 
ks = saturation coefficient [ML-3]; 
µ = maximum specific growth rate [T-1]. 
San (1989, 1992) considered the same mass balance equation proposed by Lawrence and McCarty 
(1970) for the reactant at steady-state conditions. Taking also into account the time variation of the 
biomass concentration in the reactor and introducing the settler in the process configuration, they 
obtained the following differential equations: 
  dC 1 C ⋅ X ⎛ 1 ⎞= −µ ⋅ ⋅ ⎜ ⎟                                                         (29)

R = sludge recycle ratio;  
µ = maximum specific growth rate [T-1]; 
Y= yield coefficient; 
k  = decay coefficient [T-1d ].  
Equations (21) and (22) were solved by San (1989, 1992) using the following boundaries conditions, 
obtained from the mass balances of substrate and biomass concentration at the mixing point of fresh 
feed and recycled flow (Fig. 34B), also proposed by Tuček et al. (1971): 
Cin + R ⋅CCmix =                                          (31) 1+ R

where:  
r = subscript denoting the return flow; 
mix = subscript denoting the combined flow entering in aeration basin; 
in = subscript denoting the inlet flow in the activated sludge system constituted of aeration basin and 
settler. 
Another attempt to use the ideal plug flow approach for activated sludge plug flow reactors, was done 
by Olsson and Andrews (1978) who proposed a model that simulates the substrate, biomass and 
oxygen concentrations as a function of time and the spatial variable. 
To the best of our knowledge, one of the first attempts to model a plug flow reactor with a tank in 
series configuration was done by Milbury et al. (1965). Following this work also Murphy and 
Timpany (1967); Braha and Hafner (1985) and Muslu (2000a,b) modeled the plug flow reactor as a 
multiple tanks in series configuration. In particular Muslu (2000a,b) applied the old work of Milbury 
et al. (1965), removing some hypotheses of their proposed model. In particular they changed the 
biochemical model and proposed a new modeling approach where the axial change in biomass 
concentration is considered by writing two mass balance equations for biomass and reactant and 
considering a series of equal-sized, completely mixed reactors (Fig. 34 C) to represent the PFR 
reactor.  
A steady state mass balance is considered for the biomass and substrate. The resulting equations that 
represent the effluent concentration of substrate and biomass from each reactor in dimensionless form 
are:

6.1.5.2 Non ideal flow reactor models 
In the plug flow aeration basin of activated sludge process can cause high transverse axial mixing and 
high aeration rate, high traverse velocities and irregular air distribution. Therefore, it is not possible to 
describe the process with ideal plug flow equations. Thus several authors (San 1989; Lee et al. 1999a; 
Wehner and Wilhelm 1956) described non-ideal conditions, caused by axial mixing, with the 
following advective-diffusive equation including a reaction term: 
  ∂C ∂(v ⋅ C) ∂ ⎛D ∂C+ =  ⎞⎜ ⎟+ RC                                                             (34)

where:  
R  = reaction term [ML-3T-1C ]. 
In particular, Khudenko and Shpirt (1986) did not introduce the reaction term in the equation (34), but 
coupled this equation to the oxygen mass transfer equation to find the optimal sizes to the aeration 
tank and aeration system. 
San (1992) developed an analytical solution for the differential equations of dispersed plug flow 
systems in steady-state conditions, including a reaction term based on Monod kinetics. Lately the 
same author (San 1994) introduced the following differential equations to simulate the effect of feed 
and outlet channels:

where: 
Pe = Peclet number. 
Equations (35) and (36) were solved using boundary conditions introduced by Wehner and Wilhelm 
(1956), resulting from the conservation of reactants at the exit and entrance of the reactor, taking into 
account flow and diffusion, and from the intuitive argument that the concentrations should be 
continuous between the reactor entrance and exit sections in steady-state conditions. 
Turian et al. (1975), Lee et al. (1999a, 1999b) and Makinia and Wells (2000a,b) incorporated a more 
comprehensive chain of biological reactions into the dispersion flow reactor model in unsteady state 
conditions. Olivet et al. (2005) proposed tanks in series model to simulate the hydrodynamic 
behaviour of a full scale plant. In particular a four tank in series model was developed. The authors 
also included a dead zone to simulate the reactor zone with diffusers. Furthermore, the hydraulic 
model includes the external recycle from the secondary settler. RTD tests were done to find the model 
that better describes the reactor hydraulic behaviour. Also Potier et al. (2005) simulated full scale 
aerated channels treating wastewater by applying a tanks in series model with back-mixing. The 
authors considered in the model the variations of the wastewater characteristics (concentration and 
composition of polluted influent, flow-rate, etc.). They also demonstrated that it is possible to simulate 
easily the variations of the axial dispersion coefficient with the flow-rate through this model with a 
maximal fixed number of mixing cells and a variable backflow rate. The authors also found several

where:  
Q = gas flow-rate [ML-3G ]. 
In another paper, Fall and Loaiza-Navia (2007) modelled with AQUASIM Software a full-scale 
activated sludge reactor by applying the CSTR in series model. The authors also validated the model 
by operating tracer tests. Lately, Ramin et al. (2011) modelled the activated sludge reactor also 
including a settling tank. The authors also performed a sensitivity analysis with the Monte Carlo 
method and uncertainty method and applied the convection-dispersion model. 
6.1.5.3 Computational fluid dynamics model development 
All the models described above are called “systemic models”, because they emphasize the functional 
aspects of the reactor, without detailing the localization of the phenomena inside the reactor. Thus, 
they give quite rapidly and with moderate efforts a first approximation of the reactor behavior. These 
models have a good robustness in the range of experimental and size conditions for which they have 
been developed (Le Moullec 2010b). However, they could remain unsatisfactory to consider local 
phenomena and to model the influence of the reactor geometry (length/width ratio, presence of 
baffles, effluent inlet device), the aeration process (sparging device, gas fraction field) and the 
resulting local mixing (Le Moullec 2010a).  
In the last few years some attempts were made to model the activated sludge reactor using a new 
approach: a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. It is a powerful tool which allows studying 
the influences of the operating parameters and the hydrodynamic phenomena at local scale (Le 
Moullec 2010b). With a structural approach a CFD model discretizes the reactor using a 
computational grid, formulates and solves the fundamental mass, momentum, and energy 
conservation equations in space (Huang et al. 2005). CFD simulations can define the flow patterns and 
the retention time distribution to characterize the reactor hydraulic behavior. This information 
provides a hint to the role of possible hydraulic problems related to the bad plant performance.

CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
Alex et al. (2002) were among the first authors in the literature to use the CFD approach to generate 
an appropriate model structure to simulate the biological processes in CSTR activated sludge 
compartments. The first authors who implemented the ASM1 into the CFD code through the use of 
classical convective scalar transport equations were Glover et al. (2006). The obtained model, 
subsequently called CFD-ASM1, was then analysed at different levels and was validated with an 
experimental study and two numerical studies of an SBR-oxidation ditch (Vermande 2005). Glover et 
al. (2006) demonstrated that the classical biological modeling can take advantages of CFD results in 
order to obtain the local oxygen concentration and transfer and the hydraulic structure (recycling rate 
and number of perfect mixed reactors) of the system.  
However, despite numerous developments and improvements, this approach still remains difficult to 
handle for reactors involving complex and coupled local hydrodynamics, heat and mass transfer and 
chemical reactions because of the high computational requirements. 
Le Moullec et al. (2011) coupled CFD with the ASM model and compartmental approach. The 
authors considered also the dispersion model and found a correlation between the axial dispersion 
coefficient, the gas and liquid flow-rates and the reactor geometry. Such studies should allow to 
improve the detailed design of aerated reactors in wastewater treatment plants (gas distribution 
system, baffles location). In another study, Zima et al. (2009) proposed CFD for predicting the 
behaviour of reactive pollutants  in the aerobic zone of a full scale bioreactor. The one-dimensional 
advection-dispersion equation was combined with simple biokinetic models incorporating the Monod-
type expressions. 
Even in single-phase reactors, chemical reactions are described by non-linear terms that often cause 
numerical instabilities. The high data quantity required is often prohibitive, while the complexity of 
the problems that arises from coupling the fluid dynamics with the bio-chemical phenomena means 
that the systems has be treated with attention for case (Rigopoulos and Jones 2003). In fact a lot of 
parameters are involved in both the biochemical (kinetic and stoechiometric) and hydrodynamic 
(dispersion) models. Furthermore is difficult to solve together two systems of linear and non-linear 
equations represented by Navier-Stocks equations and differential equations. These models also 
assume that the bio-chemical model does not impact on the hydrodynamic model and vice versa. This 
assumption is possible by neglecting the effect of biochemical processes on hydrodynamics but it is a 
big assumption for the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on biochemical processes. In fact the 
biochemical process can be affected by the reactor flow conditions because, the biomass, substra8te5s	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
and inhibiting compounds can be distributed in different reactor zones. This implies that the 
biochemical process can occur at a different kinetic in function of the hydrodynamic condition. 
Recently, “hybrid” approaches have emerged as an alternative. In these cases CFD is employed only 
for the hydrodynamic simulations, while the bio-chemical phenomena are resolved with 
compartmental modeling (Rigopoulos and Jones 2003). The latter describes the reactor as a network 
of functional compartments spatially localized. It is based on CFD and on the determination of 
volumes in which physico-chemical processes occur. 
6.1.5.4 Models comparisons  
The model proposed by Lawrence and McCarty (1970), San (1989, 1992) and Milbury (1965) are old 
and simple to apply but the results can present a big degree of uncertainty. More complete models 
taking into account the dispersion related to reactor configuration and aeration are the ones proposed 
by Khudenko and Shpirt (1986) and San (1992). But the best models are those proposed by Turian et 
al. (1975), Lee et al. (1999a, 1999b), Olivet et al. (2005), Potier et al. (2005) and Makinia and Wells 
(2000a,b) who considered biochemical reactions and dispersion flow are the ones. Finally it is also 
useful to apply CFD models that are more complex than the previous models but describe the 
hydrodynamic phenomena more in detail, considering the local process that happens in the reactor. 
6.1.6. Mathematical modeling of fluidized bed reactors 
6.1.6.1 Process description 
In biological Fluidized Bed Reactors (FBR), the liquid to be treated is pumped through a bed of inert 
particles (sand, pumice, activated coal) at a velocity sufficient to cause ﬂuidization. Particles in a 
ﬂuidized state provide a large speciﬁc area for attached biomass growth; this feature enables long 
solids residence times and low suspended solid concentrations. Usually aeration occurs through the 
liquid recirculation from the reactor to an oxygenator in which air or oxygen is bubbled (Fig. 35). It is 
also possible to have a three-phase fluidized bed reactor, by insufflating the oxygen directly into the 
reactor (Wisecaver and Fan 1989; Hirata et al. 1986; Trinet et al. 1991; Fan et al. 1987).

6.1.6.2 Model development 
6.1.6.2.1 Ideal flow reactor models 
The liquid phase transport of a reactant through an FBR encompasses molecular diffusion, turbulent 
diffusion, and convective diffusion caused by a non-uniform velocity distribution; the axial dispersion 
is insignificant under normal operating conditions. Thus, FBRs have usually been modeled using ideal 
flow patterns, such as CSTR or PFR (Shieh et al. 1982; Mulcahy et al. 1980; Mulcahy et al. 1981; 
Rittmann 1982; Park et al. 1984) conditions. Due to the high recirculation rates many mathematical 
models that were developed, as CSTRs did not consider the spatial gradients of the substrates and 
products along the height of the reactor. 
Rittmann (1982) stated that FBR can achieve a better performance compared to complete-mix because 
the biofilm is evenly distributed throughout the reactor while the liquid regime is still “plug flow”. 
Adding an effluent recycle, making the liquid phase more homogeneous, can change this 
hydrodynamic behaviour. That dilutes the feed and makes the performance approaching a complete 
mixing unit, which implies a lower removal efficiency than under plug-flow conditions (Rittmann 
1982). Shieh et al. (1982) tried to apply the PFR model to an FBR assuming that macroscopic radial 
	   	   8	   7	  	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
gradients do not occur inside the reactor and pseudo-steady-state conditions prevail. The adopted 
continuity plug flow equation is: 
u dC + Rv = 0                                                    (38) dx
where: 
u = superficial velocity [ML-1]; 
Rv = reactant conversion rate per unit fluidized bed volume [ML-3T-1]. 
The authors included the following elements in their model: i) external and internal biofilm mass 
transfer; ii) reactant consumption within the biofilm; and iii) a degree of bed expansion and an 
expanded bed height under a given set of operating conditions such as flow rate, biofilm thickness, 
media size, and density. As a result, a general model of an FBR reactor was obtained by combining 
equation (38) with the reactant conversion rate expression and integrating the resulting equation 
subject to boundary conditions that considers a bulk-liquid reactant concentration equal to the inlet 
reactant concentration. The resulting equation describing the reactant concentration profile through 
the FBR is:

6.1.6.2.2 Non ideal flow reactor models 
A three-phase fluidized bed reactor cannot always be described using simple models such as ideal 
plug flow, because appreciable back-mixing may occur in the liquid phase (Muroyama and Fan 1985). 
This back-mixing is caused by the rising of coalesced gas bubbles, in particular for beds of fine 
particles (Muroyama and Fan 1985). Thus, Yu et al. (1999) proposed a tank-in-series model, applying 
	  equation (13), to describe the flow pattern of an F	  BR that considers the reactor to be a combination8	   o8f

two ideal CSTR reactors. Many other investigations on the flow pattern in an FBR suggest that an 
axial dispersed plug flow model can also be used to simulate the hydrodynamics of the process 
(Østergaard 1968; El-Temtamy et al. 1979a; Muroyama and Fan 1985; Davidson et al. 1985; Lin 
1991; Kim and Kang 1997; Michelsen and Østergaard 1970; El-Temtamy 1979b).  
Additionally, many authors studied the effect of gas production on the hydrodynamics for the design 
and scale-up of three-phase fluidized bed reactors. El-Temtamy et al. (1979a,b) described the flow of 
the gaseous and liquid phases in a three-phase FBR by introducing a radial dispersion coefficient 
inside the following axially dispersed plug flow equation:

2 r ∂r ⎠
where: 
ε = fluidized bed porosity; 
r = relative radial position [L]; 
Dr = radial dispersion coefficient [L2T-1]. 
The authors solved equation (33) using boundary equations proposed by Danckwert (1953). 
The authors also identified an indirect correlation between the Peclet number based on the particle 
diameter and the gas flow rate and a correlation between axial mixing in the liquid phase, the presence 
and motion of bubbles and the radial velocity profile (El-Temtamy et al. 1979a; Mulcahy and La 
Motta 1978).  
Lin (1991) applied an axial dispersion model for the bulk phase considering reactant diffusion and 
consumption inside the biofilm and imposing Danckwerts (1953) boundary conditions to solve the 
proposed equations. Additionally, the author compared the experimental data obtained by Mulcahy 
and La Motta (1978) and Jeris (1977) with the model results and a high value of the Peclet number 
was also found that enables a simplification based on plug flow conditions. Thus, neglecting the 
dispersion term, the substrate in the bulk phase was modelled using the axial dispersion equation:

In this case, the authors imposed an initial boundary condition for the value of the initial reactant 
concentration in the bulk phase.  
 
6.1.6.2.3 Models comparisons  
The models proposed by Ritmann (1982) and Schieh et al. (1982) are plug flow and steady-state 
models, that are easy to apply but their results not are accurate. Instead more accurate models consider 
	  also the effect of gas production on hydrodynamic behaviour (Lin et al. 1991; El-Temtamy 1979a,b). 
6.1.7 Mathematical modeling of biofilter reactors 
6.1.7.1 Process description 
Aerobic biofilters (Fig. 36) are rectangular or circular packed beds used for the bio-oxidation of 
domestic or industrial wastewater. It is possible to schematize the reactors as a three-phase system 
where the liquid phase passes through the bed in contact with both the microbial film and a counter-
current air stream rising by natural convection. Trickling filters have characteristics similar to 
biological aerated filters, except they are not submerged.

6.1.7.2 Model development 
6.1.7.2.1 Ideal flow reactor model 
Many models assume ideal plug flow conditions in biofilter; however, non-ideal conditions may occur 
with increased mixing and dispersion at a high flow rate. Rittmann (1982), Chang and Rittmann 
(1987), Oleszkiewicz (1981), Costa Reis and Sant’Anna (1985) proposed a complete bioreactor model 
that includes the biofilm and CSTR flow for the liquid phase.  
In particular, Rittmann (1982) stated that the biofilter hydrodynamics are related to the recycle ratio, 
in fact the reactor can achieve complete mixing conditions when the recycle ratio exceeds 10. 
Although some researchers have found that aerobic biofilters act as plug flow systems due to either 
channelling or backmixing (Särner 1978; Gray and Learner 1984; Vandevenne 1986; Muslu 1986; 
Meunier and Williamson 1981). In particular, Meunier and Williamson (1981) modelled the reactor 
considering a plug flow regime but neglected the back-mixing effect from rising bubbles of biogas. 
Baquerizo et al. (2005) proposed a mathematical model for the biofilter based on the mass balance 
equations, and considering four phases in the system: gas, liquid, biofilm, and solid. A plug flow 
pattern is considered for both the liquid and gas phases, resulting in the proposed equations:  
∂Cg ∂C a= −vg ⋅ g − b ⋅Fg−l                                                              (42) ∂t ∂x ε
∂Cl v ∂C a a= b bl ⋅ + ⋅Fg−l − Fl−b                                                            (43) ∂t ∂x h h
where: 
g = subscript referred to the gas phase; 
l =  subscript referred to the liquid phase; 
v  = interstitial velocity [LT−1]; 
ab = biofilm surface area per unit volume of biofilter bed [L2L−3];  
Fg − l  = mass flux from the gas phase to the liquid phase [ML
−2T−1]; 
F = mass flux from the liquid phase to the biofilm phase [ML−2 −1l−b  T ]; 
h = dynamic hold-up coefficient [ad.]. 
In addition to the presented equations, the authors proposed a mass balance for the biofilm and the 
	  solid phase. Jacob et al. (1996) developed a com	   plete dynamic model and applied it to an aero9b	   1ic	  	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
biofilter assuming ideal plug flow conditions. The authors accounted for filter clogging and described 
a progressive reduction of the liquid space caused by biomass growth and suspended particle 
retention. 
 
 6.1.7.2.2 Non-ideal flow reactor model 
Fdz-Polanco et al. (1994) performed a tracer test at a pilot scale plant and obtained different hydraulic 
reactor models by fitting experimental data with the theoretical model. These authors achieved a 
Standard Relative Deviation (SRD) value below of 20% only applying a CSTR reactor and a dead 
zone model. They also performed tracer tests for several design parameters (the length/particle 
diameter ratio and the porosity) and operational parameters (liquid and gas superficial velocity). These 
tests approached the plug flow for porous bed reactors, low bed porosity, low liquid and/or gas 
velocity. However, different authors demonstrated that back-mixing could occur in such reactors 
depending on the bed length, size of the packing particles and liquid phase velocity (Martinov et al. 
2010; Froment and Bischoff 1990). Martinov et al. (2010) modelled a fibrous fixed bed reactor using 
recycle with a tank-in-series model, which is advantageous since it can model the large void fraction 
of the fixed bed and it is independent of the boundary conditions. Furthermore to account for a 
deviation from ideal flow, they proposed a schematic model with recirculation.  
Sanchez et al. (2005) proposed a model based on two-mixed reactors of different sizes and included in 
the model the biofilm and gas liquid transfer. The proposed equations that describe the two mixed 
reactors of different size are reported below in dimensionless form: 
exp( θ ! exp) $ θ ! '− a − ⋅& )E!(θ !) = %1− a (2 a 1                                                      (44) ⋅ −

CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
Also Perez et al. (2005) proposed a model based on the tanks in series model for nitrifying fixed bed 
bioreators. This model was used to provide a detailed description of the biomass, ammonium, nitrite 
and nitrate concentrations along the reactor vertical axis. This flow model is useful to describe in a 
simple way the biofilm thickness gradient along the bed as experimentally observed. 
The tanks in series description were complemented with a back-mixing flow-rate to describe the effect 
of the aeration flow-rate on the liquid phase mixing. Physically, raising gas bubbles generate a liquid 
down-flow, which is taken into account in the mathematical description of the flow model. 
The reactor was then divided into three parts: the bottom represented by one stirred tank, the fixed bed 
represented by 5 identical stirred tanks in series, and the top represented by one stirred tank. To 
complete the hydrodynamic equations, a gas–liquid mass transfer term and a liquid-biofilm transfer 
term were added. 
Froment and Bischoff (1990) focused on packed bed axial dispersion, using a low Reynolds number 
range (between 1 and 10) and the axial dispersion model. They demonstrated that the Peclet number 
of non-aerated granular beds varies within the range 1.4-2. Similar studies in a 0.2 m diameter packed 
bed bubble column with high porosity packing and a vertical co-current up-flow of gas and liquid 
have been reported by Bhatia et al. (2004). Séguret and Racault (1998) applied the residence time 
distribution method to define the effect of the mixing pattern on the process performance in a full-
scale nitrifying biofilter. They demonstrated that the floating filter bed itself behaves as a dispersed 
plug flow reactor. Additionally, they identified a direct correlation between the dispersion and the 
flow rate, and a variation of the dispersion coefficient and the residence time distribution along the 
reactor height. They also applied a theoretical nitrifying model that accounts for the observed 
hydrodynamic behavior. One limit of the mechanistic models is the large number of variables 
requiring experimental confirmation. Thus, empirical models that are simpler to implement and solve 
are of interest, such as the model proposed by Mann and Stephenson (1997). 
With regard to Trickling filters (TF), many authors studied residence time distribution in TFs (Sinkoff 
et al. 1959; Kshirsagar et al. 1972; Tariq 1975; Särner 1978; Gray and Learner 1984; Vandevenne 
1986). In most works on the hydrodynamic behavior of TF, the RTD profile is a function of the media 
used, the hydraulic loading, and the amount of biomass. TF are modeled in most studies as a series of 
perfect mixers with a dead zone (Mezaoui 1979; Nyadziehe 1980; Sant' Anna 1980). While in the 
	  model proposed by De Clercq et al. (1999) the	   influence of the heterogeneous film structure w9	  a3s

considered, which consisted of a biofilm, a free flowing and a captured liquid film. The authors 
modelled the diffusion effect with the tanks in a parallel configuration and the free flowing liquid with 
CSTR series configuration linked to the diffusion block (De Clercq et al. 1999). Other model 
approaches are also described in the literature, such as the axial dispersed plug flow model proposed 
by Séguret and Racault (1998). The authors proposed a bio-diffusion model which considers the TF as 
a vertical tube that includes the reactor filling, an immobile phase, and a liquid film. The flow in the 
liquid is postulated to be an axially dispersed plug flow, and the governing equation is:  
∂C ∂2D C ∂C 1= ⋅ −u ⋅ + ae ⋅ JE (x)                                               (46) ∂t ∂x2 ∂x εβm
where:  
ae = specific surface area available for exchange per volume of filter [L2L-3]; 
bm = mobile volume fraction; 
JE(X) = flux of reactant at the interface between the main flow and the immobile phase [ML-2T-1]. 
 
To solve this equation, the authors applied Danckwerts boundary conditions for the dispersion of flow 
at the flow entrance, and the cessation of dispersion at the output (Séguret et al. 2000). In the 
immobile zone it is assumed that the tracer is subject to diffusion. One particular case of equation (46) 
is when a slice dz is consider to be perpendicular to the flow direction, in this case the mass balance 
becomes: 
∂C ∂2
= D Cm ⋅ 2                                                                      (47) ∂t ∂x
where:  
Dm= molecular diffusion coefficient of reactant inside the biomass in the immobile phase [L2T-1].  
Additionally the following boundary conditions at the liquid/biomass interface are also defined: 
 C(z = 0) = C(X )                                                                                 (48)

Muslu (1990, 1984), Muslu and San (1990) conducted a tracer test on inclined plane trickling filters. 
The result was used to determine the following expression that correlates the dispersion coefficient for 
	  conserved tracer substances in flow over porous m	   edia and the flow rate: 9	   4

q = flow rate per unit of width [ML-2]; 
L = length of axial travel in the reactor [L]. 
The authors identified the hydraulic reactor model considering different flow patterns that could occur 
inside the reactor. With high hydraulic loadings the flow pattern is a dispersed plug flow, thus the 
authors applied the axial dispersion equation. While with lower hydraulic loading rates the authors 
assumed a complete mix flow pattern. A transition zone in the flow regime indicates other mixing 
conditions.  
Iliuta and Larachi (2005) modelled TF reactors using a two-dimensional two-fluid dynamic model. 
The complete model describes two-phase flow and the space-time evolution of biological clogging 
and physical plugging. It is based on the macroscopic volume-averaged mass and momentum balance 
equations, the continuity equation for the solid phase, the species balance equation for the fine 
particles and the volume-averaged species balance equations at the reactor level. The model is coupled 
with the simultaneous transport and consumption of phenol and oxygen within the biofilm and the 
simultaneous diffusion of both phenol and oxygen and the adsorption of phenol within the activated 
carbon particles. Using equations that account for the reactor hydrodynamics, the authors applied the 
axial dispersion model to describe the species balance in the fluid phase for oxygen and the substrate, 
	  while plug flow was assumed in the gas phase. 
6.1.7.2.3 Models comparisons  
Meunier and Williamson (1981), Baquerizo et al. (2005) and Jacob et al. (1996) proposed a plug flow 
model neglecting the back-mixing effect. Others models proposed by Fdz-Polanco et al. (1994), 
Martinov et al. (2010), Pérez et al. (2005) and Sanchez et al. (2005) included also the back-mixing 
conditions with tank in series configurations. Also Séguret and Racault (1998), Froment and Bischoff 
(1990), Muslu (1984, 1990), Muslu and San (1990) considered in the model the effect of dispersion 
by applying dispersion equation obtaining a more detailed model. Lately, CFD model was proposed 
by Iliuta and Larachi (2005). This is the most complete model because it describes a two-phase flow 
	  and the space-time evolution of physical and biolo	  gical phenomena 9	   5

6.1.8.2 Activated sludge reactor 
6.1.8.2.1 Ideal PFR and CSTR in series 
Lawrence and McCarty (1970) first solved the proposed differential equations and obtained an 
algebraic solution. This solution was approximate because they assumed that the biomass 
concentration in the reactor remains nearly constant at least as long as the ratio of the solid retention 
time to the hydraulic retention time (SRT/HRT) exceeded 5. With this assumption, they demonstrated 
that the difference between PFR and CSTR is not too significant with regard to the evaluation of the 
biomass concentration. San (1989) solved the same equations with a finite difference method, 
avoiding any assumptions that could become restrictive in the case of wastewater with high solids 
concentrations. The author described a numerical method to determine the mean residence time and 
the effect of the kinetic coefficients on the mean solids residence times, but did not calibrate and 
validate the model with experimental data for the field conditions.  
As a first attempt to model a plug flow reactor with a CSTR in series model, Milbury et al. (1965) 
defined the effective number of compartments for different detention times. Therefore they compared 
the effluent tracer concentration of a rectangular laboratory aeration vessel with the model results. 
Another model was developed by Muslu (2000a) and compared to the CSTR model results obtained 
with the approximate model developed by Lawrence and McCarty (1970). Experimental data reported 
by Lovett et al. (1984) were used to validate the model. The author obtained larger differences 
between the real and simulated data when the mean solids residence times were small. In particular for 
some industrial wastewater applications, there may be a considerable difference between the results of 
the Muslu model and the approximate analytical solution of Lawrence and McCarty that neglects the 
existence of a longitudinal biomass concentration gradient.  
Among the models cited above only San (1989, 1992) solved the proposed equations using finite 
difference technique, the other authors (Lawrence and McCarty 1990; Milbury et al. 1965) proposed 
algebraic solutions of the equations introducing some simplifications.  
Many authors performed tracer experiments that estimate the hydraulic parameters and characterize 
the hydraulic reactor model. These parameters include the real HRT value, the dispersion coefficient 
(for a dispersion model), the number of reactors in series (for a tank-in-series model), and back-
mixing flows or dead zone volume. It is possible to obtain these parameters from the RTD curve that 
	  describes the exit concentration with time. The 	  AWWA guide (Teefy 1996) gives several advi9c	  e8s

regarding the achievement of tracer tests in water and wastewater treatment plants particularly with 
respect to the selection of suitable tracer. Murphy and Timpany (1967) made a comparison between 
reactor model and lab-scale reactor hydrodynamics using experimental points obtained from a tracer 
test conducted with a laboratory tank. The authors showed that the two extremes of PFR and CSTR 
are inadequate and that the dispersion model fits the experimental data significantly better than equal 
size CSTRs in series or the unequal size CSTR in series model.  
6.1.8.2.2 Non ideal flow reactor models 
San (1994) compared his method with a method using the same boundary conditions (Wehner and 
Wilhelm 1956) but with a first order reaction instead of a Monod type reaction. The author 
implemented the proposed equation and obtained a graph that can be used to design a plug flow 
reactor, in particular it gives a correlation between reaction rate, Peclet number and biological 
efficiency. Makinia and Wells (2000b) verified the flow pattern effects of their model on the one-
dimensional unsteady advection-dispersion equation using data from a full-scale plant and introducing 
the model parameters developed from previous experiments (Makinia and Wells (2000a) and data 
from the literature. With dynamic conditions, the authors compared the predicted concentration of 
ammonia nitrogen and dissolved oxygen with the experimental data, and showed that, in all cases, the 
errors between the model predictions and the data were lower for the advection-dispersion model than 
for the tank-in-series model. In fact, even in the case of five mixed zones of equal size that was found 
as the best fitting tank-in-series model, the predicted peak concentrations were lower by 
approximately 12–17% and delayed by approximately 30–60 min compared with the actual peaks. 
The dispersion model was solved in unsteady conditions with a computational algorithm proposed by 
Lee et al. (1999a, 1999b). The results were compared with results obtained by the proposed model-
collocation with a tank-in-series model using experimental data (Lee et al. 1999b). The authors 
applied the model to pilot-scale activated sludge process data presented in a previous study (Nogita et 
al. 1983), and showed that with simulated dynamics of the reactant at the outlet of the pilot plant, the 
proposed algorithm provides a superior prediction than the tank-in-series model. They demonstrated 
the feasibility of improving the accuracy of the results by optimizing the Peclet number.  
Lee at al. (1999a) also validated the model using different numerical techniques - the orthogonal 
collocation method (MOC), the line method (ML), and the internal collocation and four elements

CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
method (OCFE) and experimental data related to the hydraulics of a Surface Flow System (SSF) 
constructed wetland process presented by King and Forster (1990).  
For all of these methods there is a good agreement between the experimental data and the model 
results, but these validations suggest that the OCFE technique is superior to ML and MOC in terms of 
numerical stability and the accuracy of the solution. Furthermore, all simulated RTD curves show a 
slower rise time and a faster tail than the experimental data, which indicates a plant-model mismatch. 
It is important to note that the experimental tracer curves at various points across the gravel bed of the 
SSF describe different peak concentrations and response times, which implies that there is a 
channelling phenomenon to a certain extent which is not accounted for in the axial dispersion model.  
The authors also calibrated the model with simulations using different values of the Peclet number, 
and they demonstrated that with an appropriate value it is possible to predict the process time delay 
using either technique (preferably OCFE or ML).  
Glover et al. (2006) calibrated and validated a CFD-ASM1 model using experimental data from a 
laboratory scale reactor. Le Moullec et al. (2010b) applied a CFD model to an activated sludge reactor 
and compared systemic, CFD, and compartmental models for a biological reactor used in wastewater 
treatment in a theoretical case, without reference to experiments. In this model, the author considered 
a gas-liquid reactor with oxygen transfer and complex kinetics and showed that all three models 
follow the same main trends; in particular, the compartmental model provided results very similar to 
the CFD model. A discrepancy was observed between the CFD and compartmental models due to the 
more realistic introduction of effluent in the CFD model. In the case of a particulate biodegradable 
substrate, significant differences are noted between a systemic model and a CFD-based model (Le 
Moullec et al. 2010b) this is due to the calculated hydrolysis process, which is affected by the in-
homogeneity of the particulate compounds concentration on a section of the reactor (Le Moullec et al. 
2010b). This in-homogeneity is not taken into account in systemic models.  
 
6.1.8.3 Fluidized Bed Reactors 
Shieh et al. (1982) performed a sensitivity analysis of the proposed model parameters using reported 
numerical values. These authors studied the effects of media size and biofilm thickness on FBR 
performance in terms of the reactant conversion rate and biomass concentration. They found that these 
	  are two most important parameters that affect t	  he FBR performance, but they did not include 1t	  h0e0

effects of the hydrodynamic parameters on the process. The authors additionally proposed an iterative 
procedure that is applied to the model for design purposes.  
Yu et al. (1999) performed tracer experiments using a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor to study 
the mixing and flow patterns of tap water. The author introduced a pulse input of a dye solution and 
demonstrated that the flow pattern can be described with a model of two CSTRs in series. This result 
was obtained by calculating, from the tracer concentration, the residence time distribution curves and 
their variance correlated to the number of CSTR reactors. The author also demonstrated that this 
approach improved the fit to the experimental data at low gas velocities and was equivalent to the 
axially dispersed plug flow model at higher gas velocities. Lin (1991) presented graphs that compared 
experimental data from the literature for biological fluidized bed de-nitrification and predicted values 
of the model. The graphs only enable qualitative agreement to be observed between experimental data 
and model predictions. El-Temtamy et al. (1979b) performed tracer tests on a laboratory scale reactor 
and correlated the radial concentration profile to the radius by varying the superficial gas velocity. 
The authors obtained different values of the radial dispersion coefficient and found that this parameter 
does not change with particle size as the fluid flow rates vary.  
 
6.1.8.4 Biofilter reactors 
Considering the ideal reactor model previously proposed, Jacob et al. (1996) solved the proposed 
system of eight differential equations, using two methods to reduce the distributed parameter model to 
a differential algebraic equation (DAE) system: the method of lines and orthogonal collocation. The 
experiments were performed on synthetic wastewater to simulate the nitrification and denitrification 
process. In the nitrification process, the experimental data was compared for nitrites and carbon 
concentrations, and a very good agreement was found between the experimental and the model 
results. In the denitrification process, the nitrate, nitrite, and carbon concentration were compared to 
the experimental data and found to be in good agreement. It should be emphasized that the simulations 
were performed without a real estimation of all parameters involved; in fact most of the parameters 
were taken from the literature or measured experimentally. Thus, this model lacks a rigorous 
parameters estimation procedure. De Clercq et al. (1999) performed a tracer test using a full-scale 
reactor and obtained improved fitting of the model performance to the measured lithium effluent 
	  concentration with a two-tank-in-series configura	  tion. This did not include the diffusion effect as th1	  e0y1

stated that this phenomenon does not influence the residence time distribution. Séguret and Racault 
(1998) performed a tracer test in order to obtain an experimental RTD curve and to estimate the 
immobile and mobile volume and the first moment of the proposed bio-diffusion model. The mobile 
volume from the bio-diffusion model and the first order moment were compared to the free draining 
volume and the mean retention time obtained experimentally. The authors determined that the mean 
residence time is overestimated compared with the first order of the bio-diffusion model. The reason 
may be an inaccurate fit of a decreasing exponential used to extend the RTD towards the infinite. It 
should be noted that the authors proposed to implement the hydrodynamic model using a kinetic 
biofilm model but did not demonstrate its applicability. To determine the range of validity of their 
models, Muslu (1990) performed some experiments using a data collected by Lamb and Owen (1970). 
In particular, the predicted and measured reactant removal efficiency, defined using the measured inlet 
and outlet COD concentrations, were compared to flow rate values. Good agreement was found 
between the experimental data and model results, with a determination coefficient equal to 0.98. 
Baquerizo et al. (2005) performed a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters and a model 
validation that compared the model results and experimental data referring only to the ammonia 
concentration along the reactor height. They only reported graphs to describe the gas concentration 
profiles along the biofilter bed for a low and a high ammonia inlet concentration, without giving a 
correlation index. Iliuta and Larachi (2005) performed a parameter estimation and model validation 
using experimental data, but they did not estimate the dispersion number because the extent of back-
mixing in the liquid phase was quantified by a comprehensive Bodenstein number correlation (Piché 
et al. 2002). Additionally, the authors found good correspondence between the model results and the 
experimental data reported in the literature (Wisecaver and Fan 1989; Hirata et al. 1986). This 
agreement reflects the validity of the model over a wide range of biofilm thicknesses and ascertains 
the contribution of biological clogging in the hydrodynamic model. In Table 23 are listed all models 
previously described and are compared the calibration and validation procedures adopted for each.

 6.2 Mathematical modelling of anaerobic plug flow reactor and non-ideal flow reactor 
6.2.1 Introduction 
Anaerobic biological processes are widely applied for wastewater and organic waste treatment. 
Pioneering applications, not yet abandoned, were mainly based on low rate reactors using non-
attached growth (McCarty and Smith; 1986). More recently, high rate anaerobic reactors using 
biofilms and bioflocs to increase the mean cell residence time, have been also proposed and 
successfully applied (Annachhatre, 1996). The growing interest towards anaerobic treatments can be 
explained considering the advantages of these processes, which can be summarized as: i) positive 
energy balance due to methane production; ii) no energy spending for aeration; iii) low biomass yield, 
leading to reduced sludge production; iv) reduced requirement of nutrients, which allows the 
treatment of many different substrates; v) low maintenance costs and little or no odour problems. Of 
course the process has also some disadvantages such as the long start-up time, the sensitivity to toxic 
compounds, the need to control alkalinity conditions and higher investments costs (Tchobanoglous et 
al. 2003; Gavrilescu 2000). To study the sensitivity of anaerobic processes to various operational 
conditions and to optimize the design of anaerobic reactors, several performance-prediction models 
have been proposed, dealing with kinetic expressions that describe the degradation and the production 
of organic and inorganic substrates inside the reactor. In some cases, these models have been coupled 
with the hydrodynamic description of the process to take into account the variability existing among 
the various configurations that certainly affect the overall performances of the treatment (Levin and 
Gealt 1993; Le Moullec et al. 2008). 
6.2.2 Mathematical modelling of UASB Reactors 
UASB reactors were developed in the late 1970s in the Netherlands by Lettinga et al. (1980) and are 
still widely used for wastewater treatment. The process is based on the development of a sludge bed, 
localized at the bottom of the reactor, formed by the natural self-immobilization of anaerobic bacteria. 
Above that bed a zone of finely suspended particles called sludge blanket is formed. A clear zone over 
the sludge blanket constitutes the settling zone. The influent wastewater is distributed at the bottom of 
the reactor and flows upward (Fig. 37a).

6.2.2.1 Hydrodynamic based models 
Mathematical models of UASB reactors generally distinguish the three over mentioned zones and the 
reactor is described by Tank in Series derived models, usually named multi-compartment models 
(Van der Meer and Heertjes, 1983; Bolle et al. 1986a,b; Costello et al.1991a,b; Wu and Hickey, 1997; 
Narnoli and Indu, 1997). 
Both Heertjes et al. (1978, 1982) and Bolle et al. (1986a,b) divided the reactor into three 
compartments simulating the hydrodynamic conditions in the sludge bed and in the sludge blanket 
using a CSTR model, and the hydrodynamic conditions in the settling zone using a PFR model. 
Particularly Heertjes et al. (1978) assumed a by-pass flow between the inlet section and the second 
reactor, a dead zone in the first reactor, and a return flow between the second and the first reactor (Fig. 
38a), obtaining the following equation set: 
V dC11 =Q C +Q ⋅C −Q ⋅C

where: 
Q = influent flow [L3T-1]; 
Q  = by-pass flow [L3 -1k T ]; 
Q0 = flow entering the sludge bed [L3T-1]; 
Q1 = flow entering the sludge blanket [L3T-1]; 
Q2 = return flow [L3T-1]; 
V1 = ideally mixed region in the sludge bed volume [L3]; 
Vd = dead space volume [L3]; 
V2 = sludge blanket volume [L3]; 
V3 = plug-flow region volume [L3]; 
C  = substrate concentration in the sludge bed [ML-31 ]; 
C2 = substrate concentration in the sludge blanket [ML-3]. 
 
Bolle et al. (1986 a, b) introduced two main variations to the configuration assumed by the multi-
compartment model proposed by Heertjes et al. (1978). He neglected the return flow between the first 
and the second reactor, and added a by-pass between the inlet section and the third reactor (Fig. 38b). 
The resulting equation set obtained by Bolle et al. (1986a) is therefore:  
V dC11 = (1− SF1 ) ⋅Q ⋅C0 − (1− SF1 ) ⋅Q ⋅C    dt 1                             (56)

where: 
SF1 = fraction of flow by-passing the sludge bed; 
SF2 = fraction of flow by-passing the sludge blanket.

Ojha and Singh (2002) completed the previous models by developing and testing a theory based on 
the flow resistance. They found that increasing the flow resistance in the reactor increases the 
magnitude of short-circuiting flows in the sludge bed. Successively, assuming the same 
schematization proposed by the previous authors, Singh et al. (2006) calculated the by-pass flow and 
the dead-zone in steady-state conditions, using the following mass-balance equation: 
                       (58) 
where:  
Ce = the exit concentration [ML-3];  
re = the effective fraction of flow expressed as re=1-(Qb /Qi); 
Qb = the by-pass flow [L3T-1]; 
Qi = the influent flow [L3T-1]; 
fe = the active space for flow expressed as fe = (1-Vd )/(Vd +Vr). 
 
Wu and Hickey (1997), instead, modeled the sludge bed and the sludge blanket as a CSTR with a 
dead volume, and the settling zone as a PFR with lateral dispersion (Fig. 39a), developing the 
following equations:

To avoid the need to evaluate too many parameters, Singhal et al. (1998) developed a simpler block 
diagram to simulate the reactor, composed by two reactors in series, each characterized by an axial 
dispersion (D1, D2), assuming that part of the liquid flow by-passes the first zone and enters directly 
into the second one (Fig. 39b). The authors applied the following dispersion equation in dimensionless 
form to both model's compartments.

Assumed initial condition for the first reactor was:

For the first zone of the model the equation (62) was solved analytically following the procedure 
proposed by Smith (1981). The response of the second zone was evaluated by using the Crank-
Nicholson method and applying the following boundary conditions:

The model proposed by Wu and Hickey (1997) was later reconsidered by Zeng et al. (2005). The 
authors added to the previous equations the following expression of the dispersion coefficient,

 6.2.2.2 Models coupling hydrodynamic with anaerobic digestion conversions 
In the literature there are also several attempts to model these reactors considering both the hydraulic 
and biochemical behavior. One attempt was done by Batstone et al. (2005) and Mu et al. (2008), who 
introduced reaction terms into dispersion equation using the biochemical model ADM1 proposed by 
Anaerobic digestion I.W.A. working group (Batstone et al. 2002). Similarly Kalyuzhnyi et al. (1997, 
1998) introduced the following equation to simulate the biochemical process, that was solved under 
steady-state conditions, using the Danckwert boundary conditions:    
∂C(z, t) ∂ ⎡D(z, t) ∂C(z, t)⎤ ∂= ⎢ ⋅ ⎥ − [u(z, t) ⋅C(z, t)]+ r(z, t) −M (z, t)                      (65) ∂t ∂z ⎣ ∂z ⎦ ∂z
where:  
r(z,t) = reaction term; 
M(z,t) = gas transfer coefficient. 
Later the authors developed a more complete model combining the granular sludge dynamics, the 
solid-liquid-gas interactions, hydrodynamics with the biological conversions and the liquid phase 
equilibrium chemistry (Kalyuzhnyi et al., 2006). They introduced the following expression for the 
vertical velocity of sludge aggregates: 
     u(z, t) V= R −WS                                                         (66) T ⋅CS
where: 
VR = the reactor liquid volume [L3]; 
T = the retention time [T]; 
CS = the reactor cross section [L]; 
WS = the settling velocity for sludge solids [LT-1]. 
 
They also used the dispersion coefficient expression for sludge aggregates, developed by Narnoli and 
Indu (1997):

q(z, t) = surface gas production [L3T-1]. 
The resulting equation system was solved under unsteady-state conditions. Danckwert boundary 
conditions were used only for the soluble substrates while, for the biomass, the authors took into 
account the wash-out in the last compartment, assumed to be equal to the upward liquid velocity: 
u(0) ⋅ Xi (0, t) = D(0, t)
dXi (0, t) z = 0
 dz                                                  (68.a)

dz                                                 (68.b) 
where:  
Xi (0, t) = biomass concentration at reactor inlet [ML-3]; 
X (H, t) = biomass concentration at reactor outlet [ML-3i ]. 
 
Batstone et al. (2005) and Penã et al. (2006) used only one advective-diffusive equation to describe 
the entire reactor. Particularly the model proposed by Batstone et al. (2005) combines the internal 
recycle proposed by Bolle et al. (1986a,b) with the internal bypass proposed by Singhal et al. (1998). 
The authors considered the internal flow bidirectional, assuming either a recycle flow from the 
beginning of the second half of the reactor length to the influent section, or a by-pass from the influent 
section to the second half of the reactor length. Finally, Ren et al. (2009) developed the first 3-D 
transient CFD model to elucidate the hydrodynamics of the three-phase (gas-liquid-solid) UASB 
reactor. In the CFD simulation, a multiphase control volume, composed of one continuous 
(wastewater) and two dispersed (gas bubbles and microbial granules) phases, were analysed with the 
Eulerian-model (Dìez et al. 2007).

b, Ojha and Singh (2002) and Singh (2005) are CSTR in series models and present a lot of 
assumptions but are simple to apply; the results can present a big degree of uncertainty. More 
complete models taking into account the dispersion related to reactor configuration are the ones 
proposed by Wu and Hickey (1997), Singhal (1998) and Zang et al. (2005). But the best models are

(2006), who considered biochemical reactions and dispersion flow integrating in dispersion model 
also ADM1 model. Finally it is also useful to apply CFD models that are more complex than the 
previous models but describe the hydrodynamic phenomena more in detail, considering the local 
process that happens in the reactor, one attempt was done by Ren et al. (2009). 
6.2.3.  Mathematical modelling of Anaerobic Biofilters 
ABFs are anaerobic packed-bed reactors, characterized by the formation of a biofilm responsible for 
the development of the anaerobic degradation of the influent substrate (Fig. 37 b). The influent flow 
can travel along the reactor both in the upflow mode (UAF configuration) or in the downflow mode 
(DAF configuration), although the first configuration is most widely applied (Fig. 37 b). The 
advantages of ABFs are the operational simplicity, elimination of mixing devices, better capability to 
withstand large toxic shock loads and the absence of a secondary clarifier. The major disadvantage are 
related to the cost of the packing material and to the possibility of packing clogging caused by the 
solids and biomass accumulation in the packing media (Gavrilescu, 2000; Rajeshwari et al., 2000). 
To define the hydraulic behavior of ABFs it is important to take into account: i) the nature of the 
anaerobic processes occurring within the reactor; ii) the production of biogas and iii) the accumulation 
of biological solids.  
One of the earliest attempts to model hydraulic behavior of such reactors was done by Young and 
McCarty (1968) who proposed one of the first models for ABFs, based on reactors in series. They 
developed a model of the process based on the premises of an ideal plug flow condition, making some 
adjustments to take into account the effect of solids accumulation, the consequence of mixing due to 
gas production and the existence of a diffusion gradient between the bulk liquid and the biological 
solids surfaces. Young and Young (1988) proposed a new model as a combination of ideal systems, 
composed by: a first CSTR, representing the inlet zone; an ideal plug-flow reactor with a dead zone, 
representing the central part of the reactor and a second CSTR representing the outlet zone (Fig. 40a). 
The dead-space region was introduced to take into account the physical configuration of the vessel,  
the formation of stagnant eddies near the discontinuities such as corners, baffles and contact points of 
the packing material, and the formation of stagnant areas adjacent to the surface. 
Escudié et al. (2005) modeled the reactor considering two interconnected regions: a completely mixed 
one representing the mixed liquid and a dead zone representing the biofilm (Fig. 40b). The resulting 
	  mass balances were:  	   1	   13

A different configuration, composed by a CSTR with a dead zone, followed by a plug flow reactor, 
and including a by-pass of the first reactor (Fig. 40c) was proposed by Smith et al. (1996). The authors 
assumed that the flow through the mixed zone and the plug flow zones was sequential and localized in 
correspondence of the biofilter bed, while the dead zone (Vd) was assumed to be parallel to the mixed 
zone with a transfer flow between them, characterized by a transfer rate proportional to the difference 
in concentration between the two zones.

6.2.3.2 Models comparisons  
 
The models proposed by Young and McCarty (1968), Young and Young (1988) are CSTR in series 
models old, simple to apply and the results can present a big degree of uncertainty. More complete 
models taking into account the dispersion related to reactor configuration are the ones proposed by  
Escudié et al. (2005), Huang and Jih (1997) and Smith (1996), who introduced a more complete model 
considering also the effect of biofilm growth.  
6.2.4 Mathematical modeling of Anaerobic Biological Fluidized Bed Reactors 
An AFBR is a vertical bed of inert particles (sand, pumice, activated coal) that serve as carrier 
material for the biofilm development. The liquid to be treated is pumped through the bed at a 
sufficient velocity to cause ﬂuidization (Fig. 37c). In the ﬂuidized state the carrier material provide a 
large speciﬁc surface for attached biomass growth. This feature permits to attain a long solids 
residence time for the development of the biological reactions and a low concentration of suspended 
solids. Mathematical reactor models for AFBRs have been developed as CSTR (Worden and 
Donaldson 1987) or PFR (Bonnet et al. 1997). Models for AFBRs generally consist of three pa1r1ts6 	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
(Saravanan and Sreekrishnan, 2006): i) a bed fluidization model which describes the effect and the 
feature of inert particles; ii) a biofilm model which describes the rate of substrate conversion per 
individual granule and iii) a reactor flow model, which links the biofilm and the bed fluidization 
models to yield the substrate concentration as a function of the axial position within the AFBR. 
Many investigations suggested also that an axial dispersed plug flow model can be successfully used 
to simulate the hydrodynamic process is occurring in AFBRs (Seok and Komisar 2003; Otton et al. 
2000; Buffière et al. 1998 a, b; Schwarz et al. 1996-1997; Diez and Blanco 1995). 
Bonnet et al. (1997) assumed that no dispersion occurs in AFBR reactors. The authors extended the 
PFR model considering un-steady state conditions and taking into account many components involved 
in the process such as: organic matter, VFA, methane, carbon dioxide, acidogenic and methanogenic 
bacteria. The dynamic model was developed considering the liquid and solid phase separately to 
compute the mass balance for all the process components and the momentum equation to link the 
solid and the liquid velocities. The authors used the model to study the effect of different parameters, 
including hydraulic and biological variables. 
Buffière et al. (1998a, b) stated that the liquid mixing is well represented by an axially dispersed PFR 
model. Studying the effect of gas production on the hydrodynamic behavior of an AFBR, the authors 
demonstrated that this production is able to modify the axial mixing degree, which is responsible for 
the establishment of a concentration gradient in the reactor. In contrast Diez and Blanco (1995) stated 
that it is possible to study the AFBR as a solid-liquid fluidized bed neglecting the effect of biogas on 
the hydrodynamic behavior. The authors also described the important role of the biofilm growth on 
the hydrodynamic behavior showing that the biofilm produces significant effects on the relationship 
between the up-flow velocity and the bed expansion.  
Turan and Ozturk (1996) studied the effect of the anaerobic biomass concentration on the hydraulic 
retention time and the dispersion coefficient. The authors applied the axial dispersion equation and 
defined the values of the Peclet number using the equation proposed by Van der Laan et al. (1957):  
σ 2 (θ ) = 2Pe−1 − 2Pe−2[1− exp(−Pe)]                          (76) 
where: 
σ2 (θ) = the variance of the theoretical response curve for closed reactor.  
Similarly, Seok and Komisar (2003) developed an axial-dispersion model to simulate the behaviour of 
AFBRs, neglecting the effect of the gas formation on the hydrodynamic behaviour. They applied their 
	  model to quasi-steady state conditions, consideri	  ng no external mass transfer resistance due to go1	  o1d7

Πj =  transport rate of substrate j from the bulk liquid into the biofilm [ML-3T-1]; 
rw,j = net formation rate of substrate j in the bulk liquid [ML-3T-1]. 
 
The authors rearranged equations (77-78) introducing moving boundaries conditions and a system of 
normalized time-dependent spatial coordinates to simulate the bed expansion, the segregation along 
the reactor height and the microbial population distribution both along the reactor height and inside the 
biofilm. They paid particular attention to the bio-particle segregation phenomena associated with the 
biofilm exchange processes observed in the experimental study, but they partly neglected the 
theoretical interpretation of the hydrodynamics. 
 
6.2.4.1 Models comparisons  
The model proposed by Bonnet et al. (1997) is plug-flow model, simple to apply but the results can 
present a big degree of uncertainty. More complete models taking into account the dispersion related 
to reactor configuration are the ones proposed by Seok and Komisar (2003), Otton et al. (2000), 
Buffière et al. (1998 a, b), Schwarz et al. (1996-1997) and Diez and Blanco (1995). More complete 
models are the ones where also the gas production is taken into account, such as the models proposed 
	  by Buffière et al. (1998a, b). 	   1	   18	   	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
6.2.5. Mathematical modeling of wet and dry digesters treating bio-solids 
The term digester is usually referred as anaerobic reactors used for the treatment of OFMSW or 
sewage sludge. The process is termed low-solids, or wet, whenever the TS in the feed below 10%, and 
high-solids, or dry, whenever the TS is higher than 20%. Wet processes take place in closed reactors 
equipped with mixing systems aimed at minimizing the in-homogeneities in the treated fluid. 
Nonetheless RTD studies carried out on full-scale digesters have shown that actively mixed volumes 
are generally as low as 23% of the total volume Monteith and Stephenson (1981), and therefore, 
together with traditional models assuming CSTR conditions, different approaches able to take into 
account the effect of non-ideal mixing conditions have also been proposed. Dry processes, instead, 
take place in different reactors working in batch or continuous conditions. They have been rarely 
modelled in terms of hydrodynamic conditions. One attempt was done by Zaher and Chen (2006) who 
built mathematical models for industrial scale plug flow reactors (Dranco, Kompogas and Valorga 
designs). The authors used both ADM1 and Aquasim® software (Reichert, 1998) as a simulation 
platform. All different designs were modelled imposing CSTR in series configuration and introducing 
bifurcations to take into account recycling effects. One of the earliest attempts to model non-ideal 
mixing conditions of wet digesters was done by Smith et al. (1993). The authors proposed the same 
approach used to model the ABFs, considering three zones: a small initial mixed zone, a large main 
mixed zone and a dead zone. A dispersion coefficient was also used to describe the cross boundary 
movement of the substrate from the mixed zones into the dead zone. Mendoza and Sharratt (1999) 
proposed a compartment model with a confined-gas mixing (Fig. 41). The authors assumed that the 
circulation around the uptake tube can be represented by an ideally mixed compartment. Moreover 
they assumed that the fluid circulation, down the tank and back to the draft tube inlet, can be 
represented by a number of equally sized tanks-in-series (Fig. 41). The mass balances resulted in the 
following set of linear first-order ordinary differential equations:

Another simple two region model was proposed by Mendoza and Sharratt (1998) (Fig.42). This model 
assumes that the whole volume can be divided into two sections, called, respectively, flow-through 
region and retention region. Both regions are assumed to be perfectly mixed but the transfer of 
material between them is limited, as the retention region behaves like a stagnant zone. Different levels 
of mixing are accomplished by adjusting the relative volume of the flow-through region and the 
e	   xchange rate between regions expressed as the 	   turnover time of material in the vessel. The m1a	   s2s0

CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
Vavilin et al. (2001, 2003) introduced a system of parabolic partial differential equations in a 2D 
reactor imposing cylindrical symmetry.  The proposed system describes the VFA and methanogenic 
biomass concentration profiles along the rector height at different times. More in detail, the authors 
tried to simulate anaerobic reactor which treat solid waste by applying distributed model that includes 
diffusion and advection of VFA and methanogenic biomass. 
Vesvikar and Al-Dahhan (2005) carried out 3-D steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
simulations of anaerobic digesters to visualize the flow patterns, obtaining the hydrodynamic 
parameters of the reactors. Another attempt to develop a mathematical model with CFD simulations 
was done by Wu and Chen (2008) who conducted a numerical simulation of the flow field to 
qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the mixing and dead zones. The CFD model developed 
was based on continuity and momentum equations and on the standard semi-empirical turbulence 
model proposed by Launder and Spalding (1974). 
Terashima et al. (2009) proposed a homogeneous single-phase, laminar flow CFD model and selected 
a momentum equation for simulating the flow patterns in the digester. The authors introduced the 
following Uniformity Index (UI), using as statistical parameter Relative Mean Deviation (RMD), that 
characterizes the mixing inside the anaerobic reactor:

CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
6.2.5.1 Models comparisons  
The model proposed by Monteith and Stephenson (1981), Mendoza and Sharratt (1998, 1999), Smith 
et al. (1993) and Keshtkar et al. (2003) are CSTR in series models, simple to apply but the results can 
present a big degree of uncertainty. More complete models taking into account the dispersion related 
to reactor configuration are the ones proposed by Vavilin et al. (2001, 2003). Finally it is also useful 
to apply CFD models that are more complex than the previous models but describe the hydrodynamic 
phenomena more in detail, considering the local process that happens in the reactor, these attempts 
were done by Terashima et al. (2009), Wu and Chen (2008) and Vesvikar and Al-Dahhan (2005). 
6.2.6. Model comparisons and validation and calibration 
6.2.6.1 Models comparisons 
The models presented above for UASB, fluidized bed reactor, biofilter reactor and anaerobic digester 
treating bio-solids have different advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore there are some models 
which can be useful in some situation and not in others.  
 
6.2.6.2 UASB reactor model validation and calibration 
Tracer experiments (performed with non reactive substrate) were carried out to validate the multi-
compartment models proposed for UASB reactors (Ojha and Singh, 2002; Bolle et al. 1986a,b; Wu 
and Hickey, 1997). Some of them were used to calibrate the model’s parameters. Ojha and Singh 
(2002) estimated each of the hydraulic parameters of the models proposed by Bolle et al. (1986a,b) 
and Wu and Hickey (1997), obtaining always good values of the determination coefficient, defined as:  
n
∑(xi − x)2
R2 = i=1
n  . 
Batstone et al. (2005) compared the multi-compartment models with the axial-dispersion model and 
obtained the best fitting between the experimental data of tracer tests operated at laboratory scale and 
the model's results in case of a multi-compartment model with eight tanks. The authors also, used lab-
scale experimental data to calibrate their model, estimating the dispersion number as well as 1th2e3

governing biochemical kinetic parameters such as the maximum uptake rate and the half-saturation 
concentration.  
The CSTR model proposed by Singh et al. (2006) was tested at different temperatures, fixing the HRT 
= 10 hours. Data fitting resulted to be satisfying for temperature values higher than 22°C, with a 
determination coefficient varying between 0.98 and 0.94, supporting the assumption that a complete 
mix flow pattern exists inside the reactor at elevated temperatures. At lower temperatures, instead, the 
model was proven to be inadequate to describe the data sets, probably because of the reduced biogas 
production.  
Because of the important role of biogas production on the reactor hydrodynamic behavior Wu and 
Hickey (1997) carried out a calibration of their model at bench scale, varying the gas production rate. 
Lately Singhal et al. (1998) demonstrated that a simple two-compartment axial-dispersion model was 
adequate to explain the fluid flow characteristics without sacrifying the accuracy of the predictions. 
They found a good fitting between the model predictions and the response of an UASB reactor to an 
impulsive input of a non-reactive tracer. Zeng et al. (2005) developed a parameter estimation 
procedure to yield acceptable agreement between measured and calculated tracer trajectories and 
obtained a correlation between the dispersion number and the up-flow velocity for different reactor 
heights. Wu and Hickey (1997) observed the responses of an UASB reactor to an influent step 
increase, predicting the working volume, the dead volume and the plug-flow reactor volume which 
resulted in a close agreement with the total reactor volume. The authors performed also a sensitivity 
analysis on the major factors influencing the reactor performances and found that the distribution of 
the tracer within the reactor was largely dependent on diffusion processes. Kalyuzhnyi et al. 
(1997,1998) made a comparison between the experimental data of Alphenaar et al. (1993) and the 
model predictions, obtaining a determination coefficient >0.99. The authors demonstrated that the 
dispersed plug-flow model was able to describe adequately a sufficiently big pool of experimental 
data but revealed also the same deficiencies in its conceptual structure. In particular they showed that 
the model overestimates the effluent substrate concentration and the amount of volatile suspended 
solids in the reactor. Lately Kalyuzhnyi et al. (2006) compared model's predictions and experimental 
data recorded by Yan et al. (1989, 1993). Although they did not report the obtained values of the 
determination coefficient or any other statistical index, it is possible from represented the diagrams to 
appreciate a close trend between the experimental data and the simulated ones, especially in terms of 
COD reduction.

CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
Mu et al. (2008) used the ADM1 as a basis for the development of a comprehensive distributed 
parameter model, named ADM1d, that used a hyperbolic tangent function to describe the biomass 
distribution within a one compartment model. The authors made a comparison of ADM1 and ADMld 
outputs and showed that ADMld was better suited for modeling anaerobic reactors with limited 
mixing and high organic load, such as UASB reactors. The model was also validated by Tartakovsky 
et al. (2008), using the experimental results obtained at laboratory scale. They found that ADM1d 
gives a good description of biogas flow rates, methane concentration, COD effluent concentrations 
and VFA under different organic loads and recirculation rates. Additionally the authors demonstrated 
that the model was able to simulate COD and VFA gradients along the reactor height. Batstone et al. 
(2005) performed also tracer tests at full scale and demonstrated that the best fitting of experimental 
tracer tests was achieved with the two-CSTR model. Penã et al. (2006) and Penã (2002)	  demonstrated 
that the ideal flow pattern occurs only when the operational conditions are close to the design 
scenario, with a particular reference to the HRT design value. They showed that when the reactor is 
under-loaded, there is a hydrodynamically dispersed flow pattern with the coexistence of a well-mixed 
fraction, stagnant zones and short-circuiting flows. The authors obtained a correlation between the 
dispersion number, the effluent concentrations of COD and the effluent concentration of total 
suspended solids revealing that the optimal hydrodynamic condition occurs somewhere in between the 
two ideal flow extremes (i.e., plug flow and complete mixing). Ren et al. (2009) performed a 3-D 
unsteady CFD model to visualize the phase holdup and obtained their flow patterns in a UASB 
reactor. The simulation results further confirmed the discontinuity in the mixing behavior throughout 
the UASB reactor and the key role of the dispersion coefficient, that decreases along the axis of the 
reactor. In order to better describe the hydrodynamic behavior of the reactor they successfully 
introduced the Increasing-sized CSTRs (ISC) model and made a comparison with a CSTR in series 
model demonstrating that the results of the first one match the measured non-reactive substrate 
trajectories better than the results of the second one.  
 
6.2.6.3 Anaerobic Biofilters model validation and calibration 
Young and Young (1988) performed tracer experiments in order to define the dead space volume and 
the mixing ratio as a function of Reynolds number for the model proposed to simulate ABFs hydraulic 
behavior. The authors demonstrated that the plug flow and the dead space increase with the specific 
	   	   1	   25	   	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
surface area of the media. Although the authors recognized the interference between the hydrodynamic 
and the biological process they did not presented a complete model to simulate both. 
Escudié et al. (2005) validated the proposed model and estimated the following key parameters from a 
tracer curve analysis: the volume of the first theoretical CSTR, the volume of the dead zone and the 
value of the exchange flow between the two reactors. The values were obtained by minimizing the 
difference between the experimental data and the model results.  
Smith et al. (1993) carried out hydrodynamic studies to define scale-up strategies, obtaining a 
correlation between laboratory scale reactor tracer tests and the volume of plug flow and mixed zone 
of full-scale reactors. Varying the impeller power, the authors defined with tracer tests and 
computational methods, the values of the dispersion coefficients, the volumes of the dead zone, the 
initial mixed zone and the large main zone. The authors also investigated through tracer studies the 
effect of liquid up-flow velocity and biogas production on the degree of rector mixing. Thus they 
obtained different values of hydrodynamic parameters with different operating conditions and media 
types inside the reactor. 
Tay et al. (1996) performed tracer tests to define the hydraulic characteristics of ABFs. The study 
revealed that the behavior of ABF reactors reflects more closely a plug-flow system with a certain 
degree of dispersion: this is clearly shown by the obtained values of the dispersion number, ranging 
from 0.0022 to 0.0045 for an HRT varying from 24 h to 6 h. Additionally the study demonstrated that 
the hydrodynamics and the extent of mixing can regulate the mass transfer and can have an important 
influence on the degree of contacts between the substrate and the bacteria, therefore affecting the 
whole ABF efficiency. In a second study, Tay and Show (1998) performed tracer tests considering 
dirty-bed and clean-bed conditions. They observed with clean bed conditions hydraulic flow patterns 
closer to a plug-flow system with a relatively large amount of dispersion, while in the case of dirty-
bed conditions the flow pattern was found to be more similar to completely mixed flow conditions 
with high value of the dead-space (from 43-51%).  
Huang and Jih (1997) made tracer experiments with a laboratory scale reactor to study the diffusion 
inside the reactor and thus defining the value of the Peclet number. Estimated values ranged from 0.01 
to 1.5, reflecting that back-mixing occurs in biofilters due to the rising bubbles of biogas. Additionally 
the authors compared the experimental data and simulation results with reference to COD removal 
efficiency, obtaining a standard deviation of +/- 5%. The calculated COD removal efficiency using the 
CSTR model was found to be close to or lower than that using the axial dispersion model. They a1ls2o6 	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
studied the VFA profile along the reactor and claimed that the flow pattern in the liquid phase was 
completely mixed. 
6.2.6.4 Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactor model validation and calibration 
Buffière et al. (1996) performed tracer experiments on an AFBR at very low gas flow rates and 
observed that the axially dispersed plug-flow model was not accurate enough to simulate the 
experimental data. In fact the tracer response curves were characterized by secondary peaks, 
suggesting the presence of an internal recycle current. The tank in series model led to a better fitting 
of the experimental data at low gas velocities. However, the model performance was equivalent to the 
performance of the axially dispersed plug flow model at higher gas velocities. The authors Buffière et 
al. (1998a,b) correlated the degree of mixing in the bioreactor to the Peclet number, showing that the 
mixing conditions of the liquid phase have a slight influence on the reactor performances. 
Buffière et al. (1998a,b) stated that for modeling purpose of AFBRs it is necessary to know the 
variations of the Peclet number and of the axial dispersion coefficient. The authors tested several 
correlations to fit the experimental determination of the dispersion number, and found that the most 
appropriate one was the expression proposed by Muroyama and Fan (1985), which corresponds to the 
expression of a modified Peclet number, calculated with the column diameter as space length 
parameter: 
DcU1 =1.01U 0.7381 U
−0.167D−0.583
ε ⋅ z g c                                         (88) 
where: 
U1 = liquid velocities [LT-1]; 
Ug = gas velocities [LT-1]; 
Dc = column diameter [L2]; 
z = column length [L]. 
 
Turan and Ozturk (1996) obtained a correlation between the biological growth concentration and the 
ratio between Peclet and Reynolds numbers with a determination coefficient equal to 0.569. Assuming 
clean media, they also obtained a correlation between the HRT, Peclet and Reynolds numbers ratio: 
Pe 0.312t = 26.6⎛ ⎞⎜ ⎟ r 2 = 0.54

CHAPTER 6 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
Otton et al. (2000) performed tracer tests using a simple tubular reactor to calibrate and validate the 
proposed hydrodynamic model. They quantified the recycling effect as a plug flow with a variable 
delay and the fluidization effect as an axial dispersion phenomenon. The authors only qualitatively 
discussed the validation; the presented graphs indicate a satisfactory agreement between all 
experimental data and the model simulation, but the model could not describe small variations of the 
operating parameters that occurred inside the reactor. 
 
6.2.6.5 Wet and dry digesters model validation and calibration 
Mendoza and Sharratt (1999) carried out tracer experiments at different flow rates to define the 
number of tanks-in series able to better simulate non-ideal flow in wet digesters. The authors obtained 
experimental results making tracer tests and demonstrated a good fitting between compartment model 
results and experimental tests. In the previous work, Mendoza and Sharratt (1998) did not performed 
any model calibration and validation but made an evaluation of the impact of the mixing parameters 
and showed that the relative volume of the flow-through region has a more significant effect than the 
turnover time (θ). The authors demonstrated that the degree of the liquid mixing affects the residence 
time distribution and the distribution of the components inside the reactor, influencing the kinetic rates 
of the anaerobic process. 
Keshtkar et al. (2003) compared preliminary simulations with sequencing batch experimental runs, 
measuring methane yield at various organic loading rates for an HRT = 3 days, to determine the most 
appropriate set of mixing model parameters. 
In the context of CFD models, Wu and Chen (2008) operated model's validation by comparing the 
predicted velocities with the experimental data proposed by Pinho and Whitelaw (1990). Finally, 
Terashima et al. (2009) made a comparison between experimental and CFD tracer response curve, 
finding a reasonably good fitting and analyzed the progress of mixing in the digester by defining a 
new parameter of uniformity index (UI). The developed model could be a usefull tool to define the 
required time for complete mixing in a full-scale digester at different solid concentrations and 
different mixing rate. Also Vesvikar and Al-Dahhan (2005) carried out 3D steady-state CFD 
simulations considering different digester configurations. The authors performed CFD simulation in 
	  terms of overall flow pattern, location of circu	  lation cells and stagnant regions, trends of liq1u	   i2d8

velocity profiles, and volume of dead zones. The results showed good qualitative comparison with the 
experimental data in terms of flow pattern, location of dead zones and trends in velocity profile. 
6.2.7. Conclusion 
Development of high-rate reactors has made anaerobic treatment an attractive option to treat 
wastewaters and bio-solids. In this chapter, mathematical models to simulate plug flow and dispersed 
plug flow of four specific anaerobic bioreactor configurations, i.e. Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket 
Reactors, Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactors, Anaerobic Biofilters, wet and dry Digesters are 
reviewed. This review details the effect of hydrodynamics/flow pattern on the reactor performance. 
Most models are based on CSTR in series and axial dispersion equations to simulate the 
hydrodynamics of plug flow reactors. They mainly differ by the numerical techniques and the 
boundary conditions used to solve the mathematical equations. Model calibration is often aimed at 
assessing the key hydrodynamic parameters, i.e. the dispersion number or the Peclet number, by 
operating tracer test. When the model includes both a hydrodynamic module of the reactor and a 
biochemical module to simulate the biochemical reactions, model calibration is also aimed at 
assessing the kinetic constants. The research also describes the attempts to validate the proposed 
models, illustrating the models capability to fit the experimental data. In all reported models 
reasonably good fitting was found between model results and experimental data.  
Most of the models described in this chapter are useful tools for operational optimization of waste and 
wastewater treatment plants but there are still only few attempts to apply the proposed models for 
optimum design and scale-up of these bioreactors. This indicates that further research efforts should 
be focused on such design models to provide a mathematical tool for bioreactor sizing purposes

CHAPTER 7– DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
7.1 Discussion and Conclusions 
 
In the present research, the effect of TS content on dry and wet AD of different complex organic 
substrates was studied. The results indicate that water plays in both conditions an essential role on the 
specific methane production rate and VS degradation. In terms of final methane production yield, a 
different behaviour between wet and dry AD conditions was found. In particular in wet AD of carrot 
waste the same value of the final methane production yield, i.e. 450 mL/gVS with a standard deviation 
of 14.23 was found. This is not in agreement with the results obtained in both dry and semidry 
conditions with both rice straw and food waste. In these cases a higher final methane production yield 
was found with lower TS values. This last finding is in agreement with previous tests performed by 
Abbassi-Guendouz et al. (2012), Fernández et al. (2008) and Dong et al. (2010).  
It is worth mentioning the existence of a linear relationship obtained in the case of carrot waste and 
food waste between TS content and initial methane production rate (Fig. 43). Such relationship was 
also observed by Lay et al. (1997b) on AD of selected dry organic waste (e.g. sludge cake, meat, 
carrot, rice, potato and cabbage), Le Hyaric et al. (2012) on AD of cellulose, Abbassi-Guendouz et al. 
(2012) on AD of cardboard, Mora-Naranjo et al. (2004) for waste samples excavated from landfill and 
Pommier et al. (2007) for paper waste. The presented results confirm that the TS content, also in wet 
AD, has a strong effect on the kinetic rates. At lower TS, due to the increasing water content and 
better transport and mass transfer conditions, it seems to be plausible that the microorganisms are 
better sustained with soluble substrates (Mora-Naranjo et al. 2004). This was not confirmed by the 
tests carried out on rice straw (Fig. 43). This can be due to the different substrate composition and to 
the complex nature of lignocellulosic compounds and difficult bio-availability of cellulose (Sambusiti, 
2013). Further tests have to be done to explain this behaviour in detail. In particular a larger range of 
TS have to be investigated to understand in detail the correlation between TS content and initial 
methane production rate.

CHAPTER 7– DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Figure 43. Linear correlation between initial methane production rate and TS for anaerobic digestion 
of carrot waste, food waste and rice straw. 
 
Inhibition tests were carried out to investigate the specific inhibition processes that take place with 
complex organic compounds. A different behaviour in terms of VFAs concentration was found. In wet 
AD of carrot waste no VFAs accumulation was observed, and all the concentrations were lower than 
the inhibition threshold values, while in dry and semidry digestion acid accumulation was found. This 
means that inhibition occurs with lack of water and this inhibition is the cause of the lower final 
methane production yield with higher TS contents. However, in the specific case of rice straw, it was 
noticed a similar value of the final specific methane production yield in the case of dry and semi–dry 
conditions but a significant difference in terms of VFAs concentrations between these two different 
tests. This might be due to another inhibition mechanism that occurs beyond a threshold value of TS 
content, that can explain the similar value of final methane production at different TS contents. Thus, 
the soluble phenols was analysed to understand better the process inhibition with higher TS content. 
An accumulation of free phenolic compounds in the liquid bulk of the digesting mixture was found 
and can explain the inhibition problems observed over TS content of 15%. This can be related to the 
effect of the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material that is composing the rice straw. Thus, there is a 
transfer of phenolic matter from the solid matrix of the digestate to the liquid matrix. In reactors with 
TS content of 23.4 %, due the lack of water, at parity of phenolics release, the hydrolysis brings to 
higher concentrations that are probably above the methanation inhibition limit. This could explain the 
specific methane production kinetics as well as the VFA accumulation due to the inhibition of the 
	  methanogenesis step.  	   1	   32	   	   	   	   	  
CHAPTER 7– DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Further studies were also done to compare the process performances also in terms of VS and COD 
degradation. For both substrates, rice straw and food waste, the better performances were observed at a 
lower TS content. This finding is in agreement with the measured final methane production yield.  
It has to be stressed that the higher TS content in the batch reactor without mixing implies 
heterogeneous conditions inside the reactor and possible accumulations of inhibitory compounds 
inside specific reactor zones are likely to occur. In full-scale reactor the accumulation of inhibitory 
compound in a specific reactor zone could imply operating problems and reactor acidification. Thus it 
is important for each specific reactor configuration to monitor the process and identify specific 
conditions that could determine such inhibition problems.  	  
In particular, further studies have to be done to individuate the highest TS content that can be accepted 
in an anaerobic reactor over that acidification phenomena occur, i.e. the maximum TS value before a 
complete process inhibition. On this topic, only one work has been already done by Abbassi-Guendoz 
et al. (2012), who found a threshold concentration of 30% TS that determine an inhibitory effect in 
high solids anaerobic digestion. This threshold could correspond to an inhibition of anaerobic 
digestion at high solids content due to accumulation of metabolic by-products, such as volatile fatty 
acids. 
Moreover further research is needed to define the optimal TS of anaerobic digestion of food waste and 
rice straw. In the present work the wet digestion was individuated as the best option to maximize the 
specific final methane yield, but there is a need to make also an economical balance taking into 
account different process costs. In particular for a specific full-scale reactor, it has to be done a 
balance between the economical return related to higher specific methane production and the 
additional costs of water use, digestate production and pre-treatments needed. However this study is 
beyond the scope of this research and it has to be treated case by case considering a specific reactor 
configuration and waste type to be treated. 
Another instrument useful for full-scale reactor operation can be a complete mathematical model of 
the anaerobic digestion process considering dry and wet conditions. This model can simulate the 
effect of TS content on the process performances. In this thesis a mathematical model was proposed 
and the model calibration was done only using the data obtained from batch experiments. The 
proposed model can be applied to simulate full-scale application, and also can be calibrated by using 
the data of full-scale plant considering the nature and quantity of the substrate to be treated and the 
specific reactor configuration.

CHAPTER 7– DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Considering all the results obtained in the present work, still a lot of efforts have to be done yet to 
understand in deep the dry anaerobic digestion process, in particular the following research gaps and 
needs should be considered: 
•  increase the understanding of the effect of the reactor configuration, optimizing the operating 
conditions; 
•  increase the understanding of the dry anaerobic digestion processes through the comprehensive 
analysis of the roles of phase separation, microbial community distribution patterns, hydrogen ion 
partial pressure and accumulation of toxic compounds;   
• understand the different effect of specific process inhibitors such as (Heavy Metals) HMs on 
different TS anaerobic digestion processes; 
• define optimized reactor configurations in terms of mixing conditions for different TS contents in 
the reactor. This can be addressed performing hydrodynamic tests aimed at assessing the mixing effect 
and the degree of dispersion in the reactor in order to define a configuration capable to reduce the 
dispersion and short-circuiting problems. 
Hydrodynamic experiments on plug flow laboratory scale reactor can be conducted with water and 
tracer, to understand how the hydrodynamic is influenced by flow-rate variations and reactor 
configurations (length, diameter, presence of impellers) and individuate the degree of dispersion with 
different flow-rate values. Hydrodynamic experiments should be conducted also in anaerobic 
conditions with inoculum and substrate to assess the effect of the substrate amount in the reactor and 
TS content on the degree of dispersion. Further efforts have to be done also to study full-scale reactor 
hydrodynamics and to model the AD process considering dispersion conditions.
