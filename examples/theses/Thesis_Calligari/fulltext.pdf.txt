ABSTRACT
Signature of protein adaptation to warm deep sea environments: the case of Initiation Fac-
tor 6 studied by molecular simulation and neutron scattering.
The protein Initiation Factor 6 (IF6) takes part in the protein synthesis regulation of several
organisms. It was also found in archeaebacteria such as Methanoccoccus Jannascii which lives in
deep-seas near hydrothermal vents where temperature reaches 80◦C and pressure is between
250bar and 500bar. The aim of this work was to study for the first time dynamical and
structural properties of IF6 produced by M.Jannaschii and comparing them with those of
the IF6 homologue present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which lives at "normal" environmental
conditions (27◦C and 1bar).
Molecular simulation gave here new insights into the adaptation of these two proteins to their
respective physiological conditions and showed that the latter induced similar dynamical and
structural properties: in their respective "natural" conditions, IF6s show very similar structural
fluctuations and the characteristic relaxation times which define their dynamical properties
shows similar changes when comparing unfavorable conditions to physiological ones. The
creation of these corresponding states between the two homologues has been interpreted by
the fractional Brownian dynamics model and by a novel method for the characterization of
protein secondary structures. The latter is presented here in detail together with some exam-
ples of other applications. Experimental data obtained from quasi-elastic neutron scattering
seemed to support the results obtained by molecular simulations.
Keywords : Initiation Factor 6, molecular dynamics, neutron scattering, pressure, fractional

RÉSUMÉ
Signature de l’adaptation des protéines à l’environnement des fonds marins chauds: le
cas du Facteur d’Initiation 6 étudié par simulation moléculaire et diffusion de neutrons.
Le Facteur d’Initiation 6 (IF6) est une protéine qui participe, dans plusieurs organismes, à
la régulation de la synthèse des autres protéines. Elle a été trouvée aussi dans l’archaebactérie
Methanoccoccus Jannascii qui vit au fond de la mer, près des cheminées hydrothermales, où la
température atteint 80◦C et la pression hydrostatique est entre 250 et 500bar. L’objectif de ce
travail a été celui d’étudier pour la première fois les propriétés dynamiques et structurales de
la IF6 issue du M.Jannaschii en comparaison avec celles de son homologue présent dans le
Saccharomyces cerevisiae qui vit dans des conditions environnementales "normales" (27◦C et
1bar).
La simulation moléculaire nous a permis de montrer que l’adaptation de ces deux protéines
aux conditions physiologiques induit des propriétés dynamiques et structurales similaires:
dans leur conditions "naturelles" respectives, les deux protéines montrent des fluctuations
structurales très similaires et les temps caractéristiques qui identifient leur propriétés dy-
namiques subissent les mêmes changements dans la transition d’une condition défavorable
vers la condition physiologique.
Cette création d’ "états correspondants" entre les deux protéines a été étudiée par le modèle
de dynamique Brownienne fractionnaire et par une nouvelle méthode pour la caractérisation
des structures secondaires des protéines. Cette dernière est présentée en détail avec des brefs
exemples d’autres applications. Les données préliminaires obtenues par diffusion de neutrons
semblent confirmer les résultats issues des simulations moléculaires.
Mots clés : Facteur d’Initiation 6, dynamique moléculaire, diffusion de neutrons, pression,

Il est certain que beaucoup de choses vont bien dans la nature,
c’est-à-dire vont en sorte de pouvoir durer et se conserver, ce
qu’elles ne pourraient faire autrement. Mais une infinité d’autres
vont mal (et peut-être un plus grand nombre), sont mal organisées,
moralement et physiquement, avec un immense inconvénient pour
les créatures; ces choses auraient pu à peu de différence près être bien organisées.

RÉSUMÉ SUBSTANTIEL

RÉSUMÉ SUBSTANTIEL
0.1 introduction
Dès le début du dernier siècle, les acquis sur la matière inanimée ont amenés les physiciens
à se demander comment ces connaissances pouvaient être aussi appliquées à la matière
biologique. La matière vivante présentait aux chercheurs une hétérogénéité et complexité de
cas que ils n’avaient jamais rencontré en physique. Elle a ainsi donné naissance à un nouveau
filon de recherche interdisciplinaire qui, alliant les domaines de la physique, la chimie et la
biologie, a fourni des résultats très importants et utiles pour des applications successives en
médecine et en biotechnologie.
Ce travail de thèse puise ses sources dans le considérable progrès fait dans le domaine de la
physique biologique notamment en ce qui concerne le développement de nouvelles méthodes
de calcul, ainsi que à l’application des techniques de spectroscopie sur des échantillons
biologiques.
0.1.1 Organismes adaptés aux environnements extrêmes
Organisms are integrated entities, not collections of discrete objects 1
Les effets de la pression et de la température sur les propriétés structurales des protéines
sont visibles à plusieurs échelles, des interactions non-covalentes des très courte portée, telles-
que les liaisons hydrogène, jusqu’aux interactions à plus longue portée comme les interactions
électrostatiques. Tout changement dû à une variation des variables thermodynamiques peut
être interprété par le principe de Le Chatelier, selon lequel toute perturbation sur un système
à l’équilibre provoque une réaction contraire de façon à diminuer l’effet de cette perturbation.
Dans le cas considéré, l’application de la pression à une protéine favorise des processus
qui s’accompagnent d’une diminution du volume. Ces processus agissent directement sur
la structure de la protéine, entraînant des changements des interactions non-covalentes

qui se forment ou se défont à l’intérieur de la structure. Ces changements produisent des
effets différents sur les trois niveaux de structuration des protéines (secondaire, tertiaire et
quaternaire)[144].
Dans cette thèse nous avons abordé les effets de la pression et de la température dans
un contexte particulier, celui des environnements des fonds marins près des cheminées
hydrothermales où l’on trouve normalement des pressions et des température très hautes. En
outre, comme suggéré par la phrase citée au début de cette section, nous voulons souligner le
fait que l’étude de l’adaptation des protéines aux environnements extrêmes pourrait être
largement améliorée par la connaissance du cadre général de l’adaptation cellulaire. Dans le
texte de cette thèse nous avons donné un bref aperçu du sujet tout en renvoyant à d’autres
publications pour des approfondissements de l’argument [85, 93, 182, 158, 107, 151, 191, 58].
La biosphère, c’est à dire la surface de le terre connue comme lieu accueillant la vie,
varie entre les régions abyssales des fonds marins et les hauteurs de l’Himalaya et offre une
grande variété d’exemples d’organismes adaptés aux conditions extrêmes. D’un point de
vue qualitative les limites physiques et chimiques pour accueillir des formes de vie sont les
suivantes[92]:
• −40◦C < T < 115◦C
• P < 1.2kbar
• ∼ 1 < pH < 11
D’un point de vue évolutionniste, les organismes qui vivent dans des conditions proches de
ces limites ont dû trouver des façons pour compenser tous les effets chimiques et physiques
que ces limites mêmes peuvent générer sur l’ensemble de structures constituant les cellules.
Autrement dit, les organismes qui sont devenues extrêmophiles ont trouvé des stratégies pour
protéger leur système de vie des dégâts produits par l’environnement. D’après le peu qu’on
connaît sur le fonctionnement de ces mécanismes, il y a deux démarches principalement
suivis par les organismes. La première est la compensation des processus de dégradation
à travers d’un réglage fin des taux de synthèse des biomolécules de façon qu’il soient
compatibles avec le temps moyen de survie des molécules. La deuxième est l’incorporation
de mutations ponctuelles dans les séquences des protéines à fin d’augmenter leur stabilité
structurale, leur permettant de fonctionner plus longtemps. Apparemment, cette stratégie ne
produit pas de différences remarquables dans la distribution globale des acides aminés dans
xvi
des protéines extrêmophiles par rapport à celles mesophiles, c’est à dire issues d’organismes
vivant dans des conditions dites normales (température à 300K et pression à1bar) [48].
Par conséquence, il semble assez évident que l’adaptation des biomolecules doit être liée à
la présence de différents motifs locaux dans les séquences des acides aminés entraînant une
réorganisation des interactions faibles non-covalentes qui règlent la stabilité et la flexibilité
des protéines. Le new deal pour la stabilité des protéines extrêmophiles se fait donc par une
réorganisation des mécanismes sensibles aux changements environnementaux. D’un point de
vue physique, une mesure quantitative de la stabilité des protéines peut être obtenue par
les différences d’énergie libre de Gibbs, ∆G(T ,P,N), entre l’état le plus stable et les minima
locaux les plus proches. Jaenicke et Böhm [96] ont montré que les protéines mesophiles
et extrêmophiles partagent un ∆G du même ordre de grandeur (∼ 50kJmol−1) même si
les extrêmophiles montrent une plus large variabilité dans l’intervalle 10 − 100kJmol−1.
Les différences trouvées entre les protéines mesophiles et extrêmophiles correspondent à
l’énergie nécessaire à la formation ou à la rupture de quelques interactions non-covalentes, ce
qui confirme le rôle fondamental que ces dernières jouent dans le contexte de l’adaptation
moléculaire [157, 147, 151, 158].
Le point central dans l’adaptation des biomolécules reste, de toute façon, la conservation
des fonctionnalités biologiques représentant un compromis bien équilibré entre stabilité
et flexibilité [197, 92]. Le processus d’adaptation se manifeste, donc, sous forme d’une
transformation des propriétés des protéines mesophiles vers les conditions extrêmes, c’est à
dire, vers des conditions physiologiques qui rendent les propriétés moléculaires des variétés
extrêmophiles très similaires à celles des mesophiles. Cette translation est obtenue par la
réorganisation des liaisons non-covalentes. Plusieurs expériences ont mis en évidence ce
processus [217] et elles ont montré que les propriétés dynamiques de quelques enzymes
mesophiles à une température de 25◦C sont très similaires à celles des leurs homologues
extremophiles à 70◦C. Des résultats analogues ont été obtenus par une étude de simulation
de dynamique moléculaire sur les différents homologues de la rubredoxine [69].
Dans ce contexte Jaenicke [93] a supposé que l’adaptation moléculaire à des environnements
extrêmes puisse fonctionner grâce à un maintien d’états correspondants entre les environ-
nements natifs, en tenant compte de la topologie générale, de la flexibilité et de l’hydratation
des protéines. Même si cette idée a trouvé plusieurs confirmations dans le passé, des études
récentes ne semblent pas la confirmer entièrement[158].

0.1.2 L’environnement typique des fonds marins chauds
Contrairement à l’opinion générale, les environnements terrestres, où la pression est d’environ
1bar, occupent seulement 1% du volume total de la biosphère. Une partie considérable de la
surface terrestre (70%) est couverte par les océans qui ont une profondeur moyenne de 3800
mètres et donc une pression moyenne de 380bar. Plus du 60% de la biosphère marine est à
1000 mètres sous le niveau de la mer. La vie au dessous de cette profondeur, normalement
considérée comme le limite pour les environnements dits fonds marins, doit faire face à
plusieurs conditions défavorables liées aux changements de la pression (de 1 à 1.1 kbar ) et de
la température (de 1 à 110◦C) qui ont des impacts très important sur les mécanismes vitaux.
Une nouvelle ligne de recherche sur les organismes qui vivent dans les sédiments marins
a été entreprise entre le XIXème et le XXème siècle par Certes[30, 29] suivi par ZoBell et
Johnson [220] dont les recherches ont mieux éclairées les stratégies de survie employées par
les organismes pour faire face aux conditions extrêmes.
Grâce à ce courant de recherche nous pouvons aujourd’hui distinguer les organismes en
fonction de leur capacité d’adaptation aux hautes pressions: les barophiles (ou piezophiles)
qui ont une croissance optimale à des pressions supérieures à celle atmosphérique; les
barotolerants (ou piezotolerants) qui sont des organismes capables de vivre à hautes pressions
tout en ayant leur taux de croissance optimale à pression atmosphérique; enfin, les organismes
piezosensibles qui se distinguent des autres parce que leur croissance est très sensible aux
pressions élevées.
A la fin des années 70, les premières colonies d’organismes dans les fonds marins ont été
trouvées à proximité des cheminées hydrothermales, des courants qui se forment où la lave
extrudée se refroidit en se contractant et permet à l’eau de mer d’entrer dans les fissures
des rochers basaltiques à peine formées. L’eau de mer est en suite expulsée très enrichie de
métaux lourds formant des courants à très haute température [98].
La vie autour des cheminée hydrothermales est devenue très rapidement l’un des sujets les
plus intrigants dans le domaine de la biologie des fonds marins et la plupart des organismes
barophiles connus à ce jour sont de facto aussi thermophiles, c’est à dire ils ont montré un
plus haut taux de croissance à des températures plus élevées (typiquement entre 50 et 90◦C)
que celles caractéristiques des fonds marins (environ 2◦C) [1].
xviii
Cet environnement des fonds marins chauds a introduit sous le plan biologique et
évolutionniste plusieurs questions de grand intérêt qui ont demandé aussi des nouvelles
explications par la biochimie et la physique.
methanococcus jannaschii Cette thèse a comme objet l’étude d’une protéine
produite par une archaebacterie, le Methanococcus Jannaschii, qui vit près des cheminées
hydrothermales. Cet organisme, découvert en 1963 [102], vit normalement à des températures
entre 48 et 94 ◦C, avec une température optimale de 85◦C, et à des pressions supérieures aux
200 bar (profondeur in situ 2600 mètres).
Le génome du M Jannaschii a été le premier parmi les génomes des archaebacteries dont on
a obtenu le sequençage complet [18] ce qui révéla des relations évolutives complexes entre
les archaea, les eucaryotes et les bactéries: seulement moins de la moitié des gènes trouvés
dans son génome pouvait, en fait, être reliée a ceux des autres organismes. Dans le cadre de
cette thèse, d’un point de vue de la biologie moléculaire, la propriété la plus intéressante
de cet organisme est due au fait que tout en partageant les mécanismes de biosynthèse des
eucaryotes, le M.Jannaschii possède des gènes pour la fonction d’initiation du processus de
traduction homologues soit à ceux des eucaryotes soit à ceux des bactéries. Cette fonction est
une partie fondamentale de la traduction de l’ARN messager et sera présentée en détail plus
avant dans le texte.
Des études ont montré que le métabolisme du M Jannaschii et sa croissance à haute
température sont favorisés par la pression jusqu’à 750 bar et que les limites pour la croissance
sont atteints à 90◦C soit à basse ou à haute pression [102]. Ces résultats suggèrent que le
M.Jannaschii est effectivement un organisme barophile et pas seulement barotolerant. Cette
conclusion semble être aussi confirmé par des études de réaction enzymatique qui ont montré
que l’application d’une pression de 500bar peut augmenter jusqu’à cinq fois le temps moyen
de vie de l’hydrogènase du M.Jannaschii à 90◦C [74] et jusqu’à 3 fois celui de la protease à 125
◦C [138]. Néanmoins, des études récentes ont montré que la pression inhibait la fonction du
20S proteasome du M Jannaschii [55], suggérant ainsi que dans certains cas la moindre activité
d’une protéine à la pression native pourrait être un mécanisme de régulation conférant des
avantages à la cellule entière. Par conséquent, un comportement bien plus complexe de la
cellule par rapport aux hautes pressions et aux hautes températures devra être envisagé.
xix
0.1.3 Le facteur d’anti-association
Nous présentons ici une brève introduction sur la protéine qui fait l’objet de ce travail de
thèse, appelé Facteur d’anti-association [170, 199].
Le facteur d’anti-association fait partie de la famille des facteurs d’initiation et il prend aussi
le nom de Facteur d’initiation 6 (IF6).
Le IF6, comme les autres facteurs d’initiation, prend part aux premières étapes du processus
de traduction ARN-messager des ribosomes. Le rôle du IF6 dans l’initiation de la traduction
est bien plus complexe que celui des autres facteurs d’initiation parce qu’il engendre diverses
fonctions qu’on connaît très mal. D’abord, IF6 n’agit pas comme un vrai facteur d’initiation
parce qu’il ne forme aucun complexe d’initiation, c’est à dire qu’il ne forme pas de complexe
macromoléculaire avec les mARN, tARN et les sous-unités du ribosome dans les premières
étapes de la traduction. Ceci est prouvé par le fait que la déplétion du IF6 ne bloque pas la
traduction du mARN in vitro [178].
Les fonctions principales de cette protéine peuvent être résumées comme suit:
- IF6 est requis dans la biogenèse de la sous-unité ribosomale 60S soit dans les archaebac-
téries que dans les eukaryotes [173, 178, 177, 212]
- elle agit de facto comme un facteur qui règle l’association des sous-unités ribosomales
60S et 40S dans le cytoplasme [178, 28]
Ces fonctions, conservées dans plusieurs organismes, ont été prouvées par un grand
nombre d’études et sont vérifiées par la présence de cette protéine dans le cytoplasme et dans
les noyau des cellules. Dans le cadre de ce travail de thèse il est important aussi de noter que
le IF6 a été montré comme très sensible aux hautes températures : dans certains homologues
eukaryotes[178, 10], l’activité du IF6 a affiché un optimum autour de 37◦C alors qu’elle était
totalement absente entre 50 et 60 ◦C. A l’état actuel, il parait très difficile d’établir si cet arrêt
des fonctions du IF6 correspond aussi à une dénaturation.
D’un point de vue moléculaire, les IF6 sont des protéines d’environ 26kDa qui partagent une
séquence conservée de 224 résidus avec une similarité de 30%. Toutes les formes eukaryotes
de la IF6, contiennent une partie carboxy-terminale de 21 acides aminés. Même si cette queue
ne semble pas être directement impliquée dans la fonction d’anti-association du IF6[66], il a
été prouvé qu’elle était reliée à cette dernière[28].
En 2000, les premières structures moléculaire du IF6 ont été résolues par des études
de cristallographie par rayon-X [66]. Il s’agit des structures de deux homologues du IF6:
xx
celui du M.Jannaschii et celui du Saccharomyces ceraevisie. Les deux structure ont révélé une
pseudo-symétrie interne crée par la disposition, autour d’un centre commun, de cinq copies
d’un domaine α/β d’environ 45 résidus. Chaque domaine contient: une longue hélice α,
une autre plus courte ou une hélice 310 et trois brin β. Contrairement à la structure des
premiers 224 résidus qui est connue et a été prouvée par homology modeling être conservée
evolutivement[66], très peu a été révélé sur la structure de l’extension C-terminale de 21
acides aminées.
D’un point de vue structural, il faut aussi remarquer que les cinq domaines sont disposés
d’une façon qui ne crée pas un centre hydrophobique. Au contraire, dans leur association, ils
produisent un "tore" hydrophobe qui, à son tour, forme un centre creux dans la structure de la
protéine. Cette cavité est assez large pour faire passer plusieurs molécules d’eau. Seize de ces
molécules ont été trouvé aussi dans les structures cristallographiques, dans une configuration
très ordonnée à couches pentagonales et dont les hydrogènes interagissent avec les oxygènes
carbonyles des résidus dans les brins β voisins. Dans l’homologue provenant de la levure
(Saccharomyces ceraevisie), le IF6 montre cette cavité fermée par une arginine (résidu 61) dont
le groupement guanidinium forme plusieurs liaisons hydrogènes avec les glycines des courtes
hélices α de chaque domaine.
0.2 matériels et méthodes
Cette section propose un bref aperçu des techniques utilisées pour la préparation des échan-
tillons qui ont été étudiés par diffusion des neutrons et de ceux qui ont été simulés par
dynamique moléculaire. Pour une présentation complète du cadre théorique dans lequel
ces techniques ont été appliquées nous renvoyons au deuxième chapitre de la thèse et aux
références [3, 56, 13, 129].
Dans le texte qui suit, les deux IF6 homologues seront indiqués par les acronymes suivants:
- aIF6: IF6 extremophile produit par Methanococcus Jannaschii
- eIF6: IF6 mésophile produit par Saccharomyces cerevisiae
0.2.1 Production des échantillons expérimentaux
Les échantillons expérimentaux étudiés ici par diffusion de neutrons, ont étés produits à
travers des étapes préliminaires qui demandaient notamment des connaissances en biologie
xxi
moléculaire. Cette thèse rapporte un protocole développé pour le IF6 qui vise à obtenir un
rendement suffisant et compatible avec les quantités d’échantillons requis par les expériences
de diffusion de neutron. Ce protocole suit le schéma usuel pour la production de protéines et
qui peut être résumé comme suit:
- Clonage de la partie de l’ADN génomique de Methanococcus Jannaschii et Saccharomyces
cerevisiae qui codifie le IF6.
- Expression du gène identifié dans un organisme hôte, dans le cas considéré ici le E.coli,
à fin de produire une grande quantité de protéines.
- Purification de la protéine produite par l’organisme hôte à fin de la séparer des autres
protéines et d’obtenir une solution assez pure ne contenant que la IF6.
Afin d’améliorer le rendement, du protocole de purification, nous avons utilisé une queue
N-polyhistidine N-terminale (H-Tag) qui a permis de maintenir une concentration suffisante
aussi pour des expériences de diffusion de neutrons à hautes pressions, ce qui, comme
on le verra après, demande l’utilisation de grands volumes de solution. Néanmoins, des
raisons techniques ont fortement limité le clivage de cette queue "marqueur" du IF6 en
grands volumes de solution. Pour cette raison, ce clivage a été fait seulement à pression
ambiante où les expériences pouvaient être faites avec des volumes adaptés. Il a été montré
que la présence de la H-Tag n’a pas d’effets significatifs sur la structure des protéines [23]
mais, vu son exposition au solvant qui entoure les protéines, elle pourrait avoir un effet
dynamique important. Pour cette raison, afin de vérifier les effets produits dans le cas du
IF6, des simulations de dynamique moléculaire ont été réalisés aussi sur un modèle du aIF6
jointe avec la H-Tag.
clivage du fragment c-terminal du eif6 Pendant les tests préliminaires pour
l’optimisation du protocole ( cfr. ci-dessus) un clivage protéolytique du eIF6 a été observé
(voir Figure 13, dans le texte de cette thèse, pour vérification SDS-PAGE) soit dans la partie
soluble soit dans celle insoluble des fractions de purification du lysate cellulaire. A cause de
son poids moléculaire modéré, le fragment clivé a été supposé être le même trouvé par Groft
et al. [66]. Ces derniers ont rapporté le fait que les tentatives d’expression et purification du
eIF6 étaient rendues très difficiles par le clivage protéolytique du fragment C-terminale.
La partie clivée du eIF6 est formée de 21 acides aminés avec une séquence, affichée dans
le Tableau 1, présente uniquement dans les homologues eukaryotes du IF6 dont on sait
xxii
très peu. En outre, une caractérisation par alignement multiple avec des bases de données
d’autres séquences connues a montré que ce fragment n’est présent que dans les IF6, ce qui
prouve son importance pour la fonctionnalité du IF6 même ou bien pour son histoire évolutive.

le PDB 1G62.

Afin de mieux comprendre la structure native de cette queue C-terminale, nous avons
examiné sa structure secondaire à l’aide d’outils de prédiction qui ont vérifié la probable
présence d’une hélice-α dans la partie finale du fragment, la région DTLIE. Ce résultat a
été confirmé par l’inspection du profil hydrophobe du fragment à l’aide de l’échelle de
Kyte/Doolittle [122] qui montre une augmentation de l’hydrophobicité dans la même région.
Finalement, cette étude préliminaire nous a convaincus que le fragment C-terminal du
eIF6 joue un rôle significatif soit dans la dynamique soit dans la structure du eIF6 et donc
aussi dans sa fonction. Cette idée est renforcée par d’autres résultats qui indiquent que les
domaines C-terminaux contribuent à la localisation du eIF6 dans le noyau cellulaire [6]. Ces
conclusions nous suggèrent l’importance d’exprimer et de purifier le eIF6 avec la queue
C-terminale de 21 acides aminés et à ce propos plusieurs tests ont été mis en place pour
réduire le clivage pendant les différentes phases de production. Le protocole présenté dans
ce texte a donné les meilleurs résultats avec une clivage réduit d’environ 30% (voir la Figure
14 dans le texte pour une vérification par spectrométrie de masse MALDI).
stabilité du eif6 Afin d’aborder une étude visant les effets des conditions extrêmes
sur les propriétés d’une protéine, il est nécessaire, tout d’abord, d’établir quelles sont les
limites qui définissent les conditions normales pour la même protéine. Dans le cas des IF6, la
connaissance de ces limites est très limitée à cause d’un manque d’études approfondies sur
les propriétés chimiques de cette protéine. Ainsi, si pour le aIF6 on peut facilement supposer
xxiii
au moins une réponse réversible aux hautes pressions et températures, les conclusions sur les
eIF6 sont très limitées.
Dans notre démarche, nous avons d’abord procédé à un examen préliminaire à fin de
vérifier la stabilité de eIF6 aux hautes températures. Pour cela, nous avons fait référence au
travail de Valenzuela et al. qui a montré la cessation de l’activité du eIF6 à des températures
au-dela de 60 ◦C. Une étude par diffusion de lumière, réalisée pour vérifier les conclusions
de Valenzuela et al., a montré l’augmentation irréversible du rayon hydrodynamique des
molécules au delà de la température de 50◦C. Ce résultat semble indiquer pour le eIF6 des
conditions non-denaturantes à des températures inférieures à 50◦C. Cette limitation a été
tenue en compte dans les mesures expérimentales, toutefois, des simulations de dynamique
moléculaire ont été quand même réalisées afin de vérifier la présence effective d’un processus
de dénaturation ou simplement son amorce.
echantillons finaux Afin de pouvoir réaliser les expériences de diffusion des neu-
trons sur aIF6 et eIF6, les deux protéines ont été préparées dans des solutions deuterées
avec une concentration d’environ 40 mg/ml et une pD de 7.0. La concentration finale de
ces solutions a été vérifiée avec des mesures d’absorption UV-VIS à une longueur d’onde de
280nm. Cette mesure a donné cependant des résultats très imprécis à cause du nombre réduit
de chromophores (qui normalement absorbent les UV à 280nm) dans les acides aminés de
la séquence des IF6. Le manque de valeur précise a engendré des fortes limitations dans les
mesures de diffusion des neutrons.
0.2.2 Expériences de diffusion des neutrons
Dans ce travail, les mesures de diffusion des neutrons ont visé les effets de la pression et de la
température sur la dynamique des protéines. Pour les expériences de diffusion quasi-elastique
de neutrons (QENS), ces mesures sont normalement réalisées sur des échantillons en
solution qui sont comprimés dans des porte-échantillons de forme cylindrique. Dans le
cas de cette étude, la grande variation de température explorée a nécessité l’utilisation de
matériels qui ne subissent pas de changements structuraux importants à hautes températures
qui pourraient modifier, par exemple, la résistance mécanique des porte-échantillons. En
outre, les expérience de QENS nécessitent des solutions à très haute concentration afin de
pouvoir bien distinguer le signal provenant des protéines de celui donné par le solvant.
xxiv
Ce dernier fait pose un limitation importante dans le volume total disponible pour les
expériences sur des molécules biologiques car ces molécules ne sont normalement disponibles
qu’en petites quantités. Dans le cas des a/eIF6, cette limitation a constitué un point
crucial pour la mise en place de l’instrumentation nécessaire aux mesures sous haute pres-
sion. Une description complète de la cellule pour les hautes pressions est donnée dans la thèse.
0.2.3 Simulation de dynamique moléculaire
Toutes les étapes de simulation de dynamique moléculaire décrites dans le texte qui suit
ont été réalisées avec le programme AMBER9[27]. Le champ de forces utilisé est le AM-
BER99SB [86], une mise à jour du plus connu champ de forces AMBER94, qui contient des
paramètres permettant une meilleure différentiation des éléments de structure secondaire des
protéines.
Le schéma général pour la réalisation de ces simulations de dynamique moléculaire peut etre
résumé comme suit:
1. La configuration initiale est créée à partir des donnés cristallographiques (codes PDB:
1G61 pour aIF6 et 1G62 pour eIF6). Au système initiale nous avons ajouté des molécules
d’eau représentées par le modèle TIP3P et 14 contre-ions de sodium. Ces derniers ont le
rôle de rendre nulle la charge totale du système.
2. Le système entier est porté vers un état stable en appliquant des algorithmes de
minimisation de l’énergie d’abord sur les seules molécules d’eau et puis sur la totalité
du système.
3. Le système est ensuite porté vers les conditions thermodynamiques souhaitées par
des courtes simulations de dynamique moléculaire d’équilibration. D’abord le système
est équilibré dans un ensemble NVT (volume et température constantes) avec un pas
d’intégration de 1fs et pour une durée de 150ps; puis il est équilibré à pression et
température constantes (1bar et 300K) pendant 700ps.
4. Une fois obtenue l’équilibration du système, plusieurs simulations dans différentes
conditions de pression et de température ont été réalisées. Les cordonnées atomiques
sont stockées toutes les 40fs et la longueur des trajectoires générées est de 2ns.
xxv
Dans cette démarche la régulation de la température a été réalisée avec un thermostat
de Langevin [195] (constante de friction 3.5ps−1) et la pression moyenne a été maintenue
constante par un barostat de Berendsen [14] (temps de relaxation de 1.5ps).
configuration initiale du eif6 La configuration initiale du eIF6 issue des données
cristallographiques eu Saccharomyces cerevisiae (code PDB 1G62) ne contient pas les positions
atomiques des 21 acides aminés qui forment le fragment C-terminale, cette absence étant du
aux clivages protéolytiques déjà mentionnés dans les paragraphes précédents. La construction
de la structure complète du eIF6 exige des étapes supplémentaires par rapport au aIF6.
D’abord la structure du fragment C-terminale (CTAIL, ainsi par la suite) a été modélisée et
partiellement repliée. Ensuite la structure du CTAIL a été attachée au reste de la structure
du eIF6 et l’ensemble a été équilibré vers une configuration stable. Toutes ces étapes ont été
réalisées par des simulations de dynamique moléculaire avec solvant implicite permettant de
réduire considérablement les temps de calcul. Cette méthode consiste dans la substitution
des molécules d’eau par des termes additionnels, dans le champs de force atomique, qui
devraient reproduire les effets du solvant sur la protéine.
Le protocole utilisé pour la modélisation du CTAIL et pour son repliement est basé sur le
schéma suivant:
1. Une configuration "linéaire" du CTAIL a été d’abord créée avec la séquence des acides
aminés montrée dans le Tableau 1
2. Un repliement initial du CTAIL a été obtenu par une suite de simulations courtes dans
un ensemble NVT (volume et température constants) avec un pas d’intégration entre 0.1
et 0.5 fs. Le protocole complet de cette étape est affiché dans le tableau ?? de cette thèse.
3. Le processus de repliement est ensuite obtenu par une simulation de 40ns de longueur.
La structure du CTAIL partiellement repliée est montrée par la Figure 16 (voir le texte de cette
thèse). La configuration initiale de la structure complète du eIF6 a été crée par la jonction
entre CTAIL et le eIF6. Cette dernière opération a été effectuée par la création d’une liaison
covalente entre l’azote N-terminal du CTAIL et le carbone C-terminal du eIF6. La structure
ainsi obtenue a été ensuite soumise à une procédure de minimisation et d’équilibration.
Enfin, pour obtenir une meilleure optimisation locale de la structure, nous avons réalisé
une simulation moléculaire avec la méthode de recuit simulé. Grâce à une succession de
simulations à très hautes températures suivies par des autres à 300K, cette méthode permet
d’explorer l’espace des configurations des grandes molécules mieux qu’une simple procédure
xxvi
de minimisation de l’énergie. Dans le cas du eIF6, la structure finale issue de cette méthode (
voir Figure 17) a une énergie potentielle légèrement inférieure à celle initiale.
La configuration ainsi trouvée a été utilisée ensuite comme état initial pour la procédure de
simulation moléculaire décrite au début de cette section.
Figure 1: Structure du eIF6 issue de la procédure de simulated annealing.
echantillons supplémentaires Afin de mieux comparer les résultats obtenus à
partir des simulations moléculaires avec ceux issues des mesures expérimentales, d’autres
échantillons ont été modélisés et simulés. Les résultats issues de ces simulations, ont fourni
notamment une meilleure compréhension des effets structuraux et dynamiques du CTAIL et
de la queue de poly-histidines (H-Tag) respectivement sur eIF6 et aIF6. Les deux échantillons
sont les suivants:
. eIF6-NoCTAIL: le eIF6 simulé sans le CTAIL attaché. La structure cristallographique a
été utilisé comme configuration initiale et a été soumise à la procédure de simulation
moléculaire énoncée au début de cette section.
. aIF6-HTag: le aIF6 est simulé avec une queue poly-histidine à l’extrémité N-terminale.
Comme déjà expliqué dans ce texte, la présence de ce fragment additionnel a permis
une amélioration considérable du rendement des protocoles de production des IF6. Les
xxvii
expériences de diffusion des neutrons sous pression ont été réalisées sur des échantillons
contenant la H-Tag, ce qui a rendu indispensable la réalisation des simulations du même
échantillon. La création de la structure, composée par le aIF6 et la H-Tag, a été obtenue
avec une procédé similaire à celui utilisé pour le CTAIL.
0.3 méthode de caractérisation de la structure secondaire des pro-
téines
Dans cette section, nous présentons une nouvelle méthode pour la caractérisation de la
structure secondaire des protéines. Le développement de cette méthode, appelée ScrewFit, a
été inspiré par la nécessité d’une analyse fine des effets de l’environnement sur les structures
des protéines.
Nous avons ensuite trouvé que ScrewFit est capable aussi de détecter les motifs qui carac-
térisent la structure secondaire et de donner une évaluation des effets locaux et globaux
résultants des interactions avec un ligand. La méthode et ses applications sont présentées
dans cette thèse par le biais de deux articles, déjà parus ou en cours de publication dans des
revues internationales avec comité d’évaluation :
- Kneller, G.R. and Calligari, P. Efficient characterization of protein secondary structure in
terms of screw motions. Acta Crystallographica D, 62(3), 302-311(2006).
- Calligari, P. and Kneller G.R., ScrewFit: a novel approach for continuum protein secondary
structure assessments. soumis.
Une autre application de cette méthode, en dehors du sujet de cette thèse, est exposée ici :
- Calligari, P. et al., Inhibition of viral group-1 and group-2 neuraminidases by oseltamivir:
a comparative structural analysis by the ScrewFit algorithm. Biophysical Chemistry,
accepté pour publication (2008).
Les résumés des deux articles inclus dans la thèse sont ici traduits et une brève introduction
de la méthode est donnée avec un exemple d’application.
0.3.1 Efficient characterisation of protein secondary structure in terms of screw motions
Nous présentons une méthode simple et efficace pour décrire la structure secondaire
en termes de distances d’orientation entre plans peptidiques consécutifs et paramètres
xxviii
hélicoïdaux locaux. La méthode utilise des fits de superposition de plans peptidiques en
combinaison avec le théorème de Chasles qui affirme que tout mouvement de corps rigide
peut être décrit par un mouvement du type "mouvement de vis". Pour la superposition
de plans peptidiques consécutifs nous avons dérivé les paramètres hélicoïdaux et utilisé
le fit le plus mauvais pour définir une distance d’orientation. Nous avons aussi montré
les applications de la méthode aux modèles théoriques des structures secondaires, aux
protéines appartenant à différentes classes structurales et à la description des changements
structuraux induits dans le lysozyme par une haute pression hydrostatique. Dans cette
dernière application, nous avons utilisé des donnés déjà publiées, issues de la cristallographie
par rayons-X et des mesures par RMN.
0.3.2 ScrewFit: a novel approach for continuum protein secondary structure assessments
Nous présentons ici une nouvelle méthode pour la détection des éléments de la structure
secondaire des protéines combinant une description de la chaîne principale d’une protéine en
terme de "mouvement de vis" (Acta Cryst. 62, 302-311 (2006)) et une approche statistique.
L’application de cette méthode produit des intervalles de confiance qui définissant les
variations naturelles des paramètres hélicoïdaux qui décrivent la chaîne principale. Afin
d’établir ces intervalles pour chaque motif (pattern) de structure secondaire, nous avons
analysé plusieurs bases de données contenant des structure de protéines caractérisées par
un profil structural bien défini. Cette méthode permet une évaluation "continue" de la
structure secondaire d’une protéine et a été démontrée stable par rapport aux variations
structurales, trouvées dans les donnés RMN, et à la résolution expérimentale des donnés
cristallographiques. La comparaison avec d’autres méthodes confirme sa précision et fiabilité.
L’exemple de l’analyse de la structure de l’inhibiteur trypsine pancréatique bovine dans
ses trois différentes formes cristallines montre la capacité de notre méthode de détecter
et d’analyser des petites variations structurales dans des données expérimentales très bruitées.
0.3.3 L’algorithme ScrewFit
A fin de décrire d’une manière simple la structure secondaire des protéines, nous avons utilisé
l’algorithme ScrewFit, qui est basé sur la superposition optimale de structures moléculaires
xxix
[50, 115, 116] et sur le théorème de Chasles [33, 32].
Nous pouvons considérer deux plans peptidiques consécutifs A et B, comme deux corps
rigides définis par les positions des atomes {O,C,N} de chaque plan. Ces corps rigides
peuvent être superposés en minimisant la fonction suivante:
∑3
m(q) = (D · xα − x ′ 2α) , (0.1)
α=1
où {x } et {x ′α α} sont respectivement les positions atomiques de la structure de référence (les
atomes {O,C,N} dans le plan A) et celles de la structure cible (plan B). Le symbole D dénote
une matrice orthogonale qui décrit une rotation. Les deux ensembles des coordonnées sont
définis par rapport à un point de référence qui est la position de l’atome de carbone de
chaque plan {O,C,N}. En utilisant le fait qu’une matrice de rotation peut être exprimée par
les composantes d’un quaternion normalisé q ≡ {q ,q ,q ,q }, où q20 1 2 3 + q2 + q2 + q2 = 1 [4],
 0 1 2 3
 q20 + q21 − q22 − q2 3
2(−q0q3 + q1q2) 2(q0q2 + q1q3) 
 D(q) =  2(q q + q q ) q2 + q2 − q2 − q2 2(−q q + q q )  , (0.2)0 3 1 2 0 2 1 3 0 1 2 3
2(−q q + q q 2 2 2 20 2 1 3) 2(q0q1 + q2q3) q0 + q3 − q1 − q2
la fonction (6.1) peut être minimisée par rapport à ces quatre composantes. Comme il a
été montré dans d’autres études [50, 115, 116], la minimisation avec contraintes peut être
transformée dans un problème de valeurs propres d’une matrice M semi-definie positive
M ≡M({x , x ′α α}),
M · q = λq, (0.3)
où les valeurs propres λj = m(qj) sont les possibles erreurs dans la superposition des
deux plans peptidiques défini par (6.1). Le quaternion correspondant à la valeur propre la
plus petite est la solution pour une superposition optimale et ses composantes décrivent
l’orientatio ′n relative de {xα} par rapport à {xα}. La relation:
q ≡ q0  cos(φ/2)=  . (0.4)
qv sin(φ/2)n
nous montre que le quaternion correspondant à la valeur propre la plus petite définit aussi un
angle de rotation φ et un axe de rotation n, ce dernier étant aussi la direction du "mouvement
de vis" décrit dans le théorème de Chasles. La preuve de ce dernier théorème peut être trouvée
dans la référence [114]. La valeur propre la plus grande λmax décrit la "pire" superposition
xxx
possible entre les deux plans peptidiques et donne leur distance euclidienne maximale. Nous
avons utili√sé ce dernier fait pour définir une distance d’orientation unique par∑3 (x − x ′ )2
∆ = α=1
α α . (0.5)
λmax
Par définition 0 6 ∆ 6 1.
La caractérisation de la structure secondaire d’une protéine est réalisée dans cette méthode
avec les paramètres suivants:
1. La distance d’orientation entre deux plans consécutifs, défini par Eq. (6.5).
2. Le rayon de la surface cylindrique sur laquelle bouge l’atome de référence (atome C)
en réalisant le "mouvement de vis" entre deux plans peptidique comme décrit par le
théorème de C√hasles,
|t⊥|
ρ = 1+ cot2(φ/2). (0.6)
2
Ici t⊥ est la composante perpendiculaire à l’axe de rotation n du vecteur t qui relie les
atomes C.
3. Le paramètre de "rectitude" σ. Pour chaque résidu i ce dernier est défini comme suit:
σ = µTi i · µi+1, (0.7)
où
R⊥i+1 −R
⊥
= iµi (0.8)
|R⊥ ⊥i+1 −Ri |
et R⊥i est le point de l’axe hélicoïdal le plus proche de l’atome C du plan peptidique i.
La "rectitude" donne des renseignements sur la courbure des éléments de la structure
secondaire.
0.3.4 Application de ScrewFit à des structures modèles
Nous présentons ici un exemple d’application simple de la méthode ScrewFit. Il s’agit de
structures-modèles différemment configurées et composées de 10 alanines et qui ont été
obtenues par le Image Library of Biological Macromolecules in Jena 2 (les valeurs obtenues
sont affichés dans le tableau 2).
Les résultats remarquables de cette application sont:

0.4 résultats
Nous présentons ici les principaux résultats obtenus dans ce travail de thèse soit par le
moyen de simulations de dynamique moléculaire (MD) soit par les expériences de diffusion
quasi-élastique des neutrons (QENS). Ces résultats seront utilisés pour déterminer les effets
locaux et globaux des conditions environnementales sur les deux homologues du IF6. Le lien
entre ces deux types d’effets est assuré par la complémentarité des informations obtenues par
dynamique moléculaire et par diffusion des neutrons.
Les conditions d’environnement appliqués dans les deux cas sont affichées dans les Tableaux
4 et 3.
Le nombre et la variété des mesures expérimentales ont été largement limités par des
problèmes techniques qui seront discutés plus avant dans le texte. La comparaison entre
données QENS et MD a été quand même possible dans un nombre restreint de cas. Pour la
raison énoncée, les données affichées dans cette section sont issues des simulations MD sauf

0.4.1 Effets de la pression et de la température sur la structure des IF6
Les principaux effets de la température et de la pression sur les deux homologues du IF6 ont
été caractérisés autant d’un point de vue global que local.
Dans le premier cas, nous avons observé les changements du volume moléculaire des
deux protéines ainsi que les changements de leurs rayons de gyration et de leurs surfaces
accessibles au solvant. Dans le deuxième cas, une caractérisation fine des changements de la
structure secondaire a été obtenue par l’étude des fluctuations des atomes de carbone α et
l’analyse effectuée avec la méthode ScrewFit.
Les principaux effets globaux trouvés sont ici résumés:
· Les changements du volume moléculaire et du rayon de gyration montrent que le aIF6
est moins sensible au changements environnementaux que son homologue mesophile.
Figures 2 et 3
· Le rayon de gyration et la surface accessible au solvant du aIF6 affichent, aux conditions
naturelles pour Methanococcus Jannaschii (350K -500bar), des valeurs très similaires à
celles du eIF6 dans des conditions normales. Ce résultat semble suggérer la présence d’
"états correspondants" entre les conditions naturelles des deux homologues.
Les fluctuations des chaînes principales et les variations des paramètres ScrewFit montrent
les résultats suivants:
aIF6
· A une haute température les régions autour du résidu 60 et comprises entre les résidus
120 et 130 subissent des distorsions indiquant des changements d’orientation des plans
peptidiques de la chaîne principale qui cependant n’entraînent pas de courbures de cette
dernière. Nous avons observé que ces changements ne se produisent pas aux hautes
pressions.
xxxiv
· La haute pression induit une courbure significative sur la structure principale du aIF6 dans
la région comprise entre les résidus 90 et 95. Cet effet engendre aussi une augmentation
des fluctuations atomiques dans la même région.
· La combinaison de haute température et haute pression modifie les configurations des
plans peptidiques autour du résidu 50 vers des orientations relatives plutôt hélicoïdales.
eIF6
· Des importantes variations dans la région 220-245 sont engendrées par les fluctuations
du CTAIL. Comme on pouvait l’attendre, ces variations augmentent en fonction de la
température.
· Différentes variations dans la région 170-180 se produisent tant à haute température
qu’à haute pression mais elles disparaissent quand la pression et la température sont
appliquées de façon simultanée.
· La combinaison d’une haute pression (500bar) et d’une haute température (350K) produit
une courbure de la partie C-terminale de la longue hélice-α dans la région 35-45.
Certains des ces effets locaux sur la structure ont été ensuite reliés aux possibles effets
sur la fonction du IF6. En particulier, nous avons remarqué que la pression a des effets très
importants sur la configuration des sérines 174 et 175 dans le eIF6. Ces deux derniers acides
aminés ont un rôle essentiel dans la localisation du IF6 dans le noyau cellulaire parce que
leur phosphorylation permet le passage du IF6 entre noyau et cytoplasme.
La présence des états correspondants entre les deux protéines dans leurs conditions naturelles
est ultérieurement confirmée par l’étude du facteur de structure élastique incohérent (EISF,
voir texte de la thèse) qui donne accès aux fluctuations atomiques en fonction de l’échelle
de longueur explorée par les mouvements internes des protéines. La figure 4 montre les
fluctuations carrées moyennes en fonction du transfert de quantité de mouvement, q.
Pour mieux comprendre les effets de la présence du CTAIL dans le eIF6 et celle possible de
la H-Tag dans le aIF6, nous avons réalisé les mêmes études structurales sur eIF6-NoCTAIL et
sur aIF6-HTag. Les résultats les plus remarquables de ces études ont été que le eIF6-NoCTAIL
affiche des changements très similaires à ceux qui ont caractérisé le aIF6 et que l’aIF6-HTag
montre des propriétés similaire a celles du eIF6. Ces observations suggèrent que la présence
d’une "queue" additionnelle dans les deux structures des IF6 joue un rôle crucial dans la

0.4.2 Effets dynamiques de la pression et de la température
Afin de caractériser les effets dynamiques d’un environnement extrême sur les IF6, les donnés
issues des simulations MD et celles obtenues par mesures QENS ont été comparées. Les
quantités "naturelles" pour l’analyse des simulations MD sont celles reliées à des fonctions
dépendant du temps, tels que le déplacement carré moyen, ou bien aux fonctions des
corrélations comme la fonction intermédiaire de diffusion. Les mesures expérimentales sont
au contraire étudiées par l’analyse du facteur de structure dynamique qui est une quantité
reliée au transfert de la quantité de mouvement et aux variations d’énergie. La fonction
intermédiaire de diffusion et le facteur de structure dynamique d’une protéine peuvent être
bien représentés par le modèle de dynamique Brownienne fractionnaire (fOU, dans la suite)
[119, 20]. Ce modèle donne des temps de relaxation qui définissent la dynamique interne des
protéines en fonction d’une échelle de longueur.

Les résultats sur les effets dynamiques de la pression et de la température peuvent être
résumés comme suit:
Les temps de relaxation définis par le fOU affichent des valeurs très différentes dans les
deux protéines. En particulier, dans le cas du aIF6, ils sont systématiquement plus
rapides que ceux du eIF6 à toutes les échelles de longueur.
Les mêmes temps caractéristiques des deux protéines changent d’une façon différente en
fonction de la pression et de la température. En particulier ils augmentent en fonction
de la pression dans le cas du aIF6 et ils baissent dans le cas du eIF6.
Ces dernières observations identifient plutôt les caractères dynamiques de chaque homo-
logue du IF6 et de sa réponse aux changements des conditions environnementales. Cette
dernière réponse devient par contre évidente si l’on compare les temps de relaxation de
chaque homologue dans ses conditions "naturelles" avec ceux affichés dans des condition
défavorables. Les Figures 5 et 6 montrent que dans les deux homologues les conditions les
plus défavorables produisent des changements non homogènes dans le temps de relaxation et
que ces changements deviennent de plus en plus homogènes en se rapprochant des conditions
"naturelles".

0.5 conclusions
Dans ce travail nous avons caractérisé la réponse des deux homologues du IF6 à différentes
conditions extrêmes. Ces réponses ont été caractérisées d’un point de vue autant structural
que dynamique.
L’étude structurale a montré que l’aIF6, bien que moins sensible aux changements de
température et de pression, assume dans ces conditions "naturelles" (350K -500bar) des
caractéristiques structurales très similaires à celle du eIF6 à température et pression ambiante.
Nous avons aussi distingués les effets globaux des effets locaux, qui sont très différents
dans les deux IF6. En outre, contrairement aux attentes, les effets des deux variables thermo-
dynamiques ne s’opposent pas les uns aux autres.
D’un point de vue dynamique, le modèle de dynamique Brownienne fractionnaire
nous a permis d’associer des temps caractéristiques à chaque protéine. Ces temps, qui

dépendent de l’échelle de longueur considérée, affichent des valeurs différentes dans les
deux protéines dans des conditions environnementales diverses alors qu’ils changent
d’une façon similaire si les protéines sont dans des conditions défavorables. Ces résul-
tats nous ont permis d’identifier d’abord la présence des "états correspondants" des
fluctuations structurales de chaque homologue du IF6 dans ses conditions naturelles.
Deuxièmement ils ont rendu possible la distinction entre les propriétés dynamiques reliées à
la structure de chaque protéine et les propriétés caractérisant l’état naturel de chaque protéine.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION
The last century owes the majority of its advances in science and technology to the
investigation of the structure and dynamics of matter at the atomic and subatomic scale
which lead, among others, to a significantly better understanding of the physical and
chemical properties of solids and liquids.
Since the beginning of the century, the knowledge acquired about the inanimate matter lead
physicists to question how this insight could also be applied also to biological matter. To
this end, most of the principles of thermodynamics and classical mechanics were applied to
biological systems to gain new insights into their properties, but only the advent of quantum
theory and statistical mechanics finally allowed them to be investigated at the atomic scale.
These new theories, along with important developments in the techniques of atomic and
molecular spectroscopy lead researchers to revise and interpret from a molecular point of
view several results obtained in biology in the last century. 1
Living matter presented to researchers a degree of heterogeneity and complexity that they
had never encountered before in physics and stimulated the birth of a new interdisciplinary
field of research which brought together physics, chemistry and biology and which revealed
itself as a source for a large number of key results with further applications in medicine and
biotechnology.
The work presented in this thesis is based on the enormous progress made in the field of
biological physics, in particular with respect to the development of computer simulation
methods, made possible by the rapid improvements in computers, and the application of
spectroscopic techniques to biological samples.
As will be explained more deeply, later in the text, these two techniques can be combined in a
unified approach in which computer simulations helps to better characterize the experimental
results at the atomic scale.
1 As an example, it is worth to cite the famous prediction by E.Schroedinger who inferred from the basic quantum
mechanical principles, that the structure of DNA had to be that of an aperiodic lattice. His prediction was then
confirmed years later by the crystallographic resolution of the DNA structure made by Watson and Crick.

8 general introduction
In the following, a general introduction to this thesis work will be given assuming a basic
knowledge of protein structure elements the explanation of which would be beyond of the
scope of this thesis. This subject is however treated in detail in a number of excellent textbooks
[42, 187]
1.1 effects of pressure and temperature on proteins
In the very first efforts to investigate living matter, physicists focused on the application of
basic principles of mechanics and thermodynamics to interpret the complexity of biological
macromolecules [30].
As this thesis deals essentially with the effects of temperature and pressure on proteins, the
following sections will concentrate on this subject, giving a short presentation of the known
effects of these two thermodynamic variables on the structure and dynamics of proteins.
Pioneering work on the impact of pressure on proteins was performed by Regnard in 1891
[160] and by Bridgman in 1914 [17]. The former showed that pressure below 1kbar affects
reversibly the catalytic functions in bacteria, whereas the second proved that pressures
above 8kbar lead to a coagulation of the protein ovalbumin. Moreover, Bridgman also noted
that high temperature reduced the effects of high pressure on albumin, i.e. reduced the
coagulation.
These studies yielded the important result that two types of pressure effects have to be
distinguished: irreversible and reversible effects depending on the magnitude of the applied
pressure [75]. The same observations have been made concerning temperature induced
changes [42, 189].
When irreversible effects produced by high pressure (as well as by high temperature) are
present, a large change in the spatial conformation affects proteins which loose their native
structure. In these new denaturated states, proteins cannot perform their functions and
tend to have unusual interactions with other proteins leading to large aggregates. Partially
denaturated states (also known as molten globules) can be included among the reversible
effects because when pressure or temperature are brought back to their original values
proteins fold back in their native configuration [42].
Several more recent works [143, 219, 169, 99], showed also that : i) proteins do not all have
the same characteristic threshold for denaturing pressures: it depends of their size and shape;
ii) denaturing caused by high temperature is often very different from denaturing caused by
1.1 effects of pressure and temperature on proteins 9
freezing or by high pressure.
In summary, these results, which will be discussed in the following, show that high
temperature and high pressure have similar effects on protein stability but they appear to
be competitive when applied together. Moreover, the structural changes of proteins due to
external pressure are much less homogenous than those induced by temperature changes.
le chatelier’s principle A useful theoretical framework for the comprehension of
how biomolecules respond to changes in thermodynamic conditions is given by the criteria
for the stability of thermodynamic systems and by Le Chatelier’s principle[126]. The latter
states that at equilibrium, a system tends to minimize the effect of any external factor by
which it is perturbed. As briefly shown in the following, Le Chatelier’s principle gives the
physical interpretation of the stability criteria for the thermodynamical potentials which
describe the macroscopic states of the system. Indeed these criteria reflect those demanded
for the intrinsic stability of the thermodynamic system itself. For an equilibrium process
connecting two states A and B, the general expression for the variation of Gibbs free energy,
G(T,P,N) reads as follows:
∑
∆G = V∆P− S∆T + µi ∆Ni (1.1)
i
where ∆Ni, ∆P and ∆T are, respectively, the variation in number of particles of type i and
the change in pressure and temperature. In the case of the Gibbs free energy, the stability
criteria lead to the condition that the function G(T,P,N) be concave with respect to variables T
and P and convex with respect to Ni [21]. From a mathematical point of view, this means that
the second order derivatives of the function G(T,P,N) with respect to T and P must be negative.
These conditions can be rewritten with respect to the natural thermodynamic variables by
means of the Maxwell relations:
( ) ( )
∂2G ∂V
( ) =∂P2 T (∂P) 6 0 (1.2)T
∂2G ∂S
= − 6 0 (1.3)
∂T2 P ∂T P
As a consequence, an increase in pressure on a system favors a reduction of its conjugated
extensive variable, the volume. Hence, in general, pressure favors all processes that are
10 general introduction
accompained by negative volume changes.
In the case of proteins, which usually have compact and tightly packed structures, three
different types of volumes can be distinguished: the volume of atoms, the void volume due to
imperfect packing of atoms which leave small cavities at the interior of molecular structures
and the volume variations which result from the degree of solvation of peptide bonds and
amino acids residues. All these components influence both the atomic fluctuations and the
weak intramolecular interactions (i.e. those not involving covalent bonds) which govern the
transition between its various conformations.
Besides giving a general framework for the understanding of the effects of pressure on
proteins, the Le Chatelier principle also introduces a first explanation of the antagonistic
relation between temperature and pressure. The principle states in fact that perturbations
on a system directly induce processes that attenuate the perturbations themselves but its
response also induces indirectly other processes that reduce the initial perturbation. A
phenomenological demonstration of this extension of principle, which is usually called
LeChatelier-Braun principle, can be found in references [21, 161].
From a molecular point of view, the antagonism between the two variables can be inter-
preted by the microscopic ordering principle, which states that an increase in pressure at
constant temperature leads to a decrease in the entropy of the system, which corresponds to
an increase in the ordering of molecules in the system itself.
This is a general property of molecular systems but it has also a strict sense for protein stability
as proven by Brandts et al. [16] and Hawley [72] who showed that the pressure-temperature
phase diagram which determines the transition between functional and denaturated states
of proteins has elliptic boundaries, meaning that there exist several combinations of the P,T
variables which are compatible with the stability criteria. This peculiar behavior has been
ascribed to the exposure of hydrophobic groups to the solvent when the protein folds. It is
worth to note that this behavior is found neither in nucleic acids [73] nor in lipids [47]. The
elliptic phase boundaries, which are also found in liquid crystals, seems to be produced by a
fine balance between aromatic and aliphatic parts of molecules.
effects of pressure on intermolecular interactions The stability of
biomolecules results from a cooperation of interactions involving its components and the
external environment [93]. In the case of proteins, once the primary structure is formed
1.1 effects of pressure and temperature on proteins 11
by the peptide bonds, the interactions that play a significant role in this cooperation are
essentially weak [94].
The electronic structure of atoms and the covalent bonds are directly modified by
pressure only for values greater than 30kbar [51]and 15kbar [67, 144], respectively, but their
compression is negligible[62]. Their breaking is responsible for big changes in free volume
and leads to a totally irreversible protein denaturation. The formation of covalent bonds has a
∆V = −10ml.mol−1, whereas ∆V values for the changes in bonds or bond angle changes are
nearly zero [200]. Besides the peptide bonds that form the primary structure of proteins, the
only type of covalent bond which plays a significant role in protein stability is the interchain
disulphide bonds formed by non-contiguous cysteine residues [43].
In contrast to covalent bonds, weak non-bonding interactions give a large contribution to
the observed ∆V due to pressure changes.
■♦♥✐❝ ✐♥t❡r❛❝t✐♦♥s Ion pairs in proteins cause attractive, short-range interactions that occur
between negatively and positively-charged amino-acid side chains over a distance of 4 Å[42].
The role of ion pairs in proteins is to stabilize the tertiary [76] and quaternary structure.
For example, interprotein salt bridges provide a mechanism for solvent exclusion from the
interfacial domain of the cytochrome b5-cytochrome c complex, in addition to maintaining
the stability and specificity of the complex formed [165].
When an ion is formed in solution, the nearby water dipoles are compressed by the
Coulombic field of the ion; this phenomenon, which is accompained by a volume decrease, is
usually called electrostriction. Because of this volume contraction, pressure is expected to favor
the disruption of ion-pair but Michels et al. [139] have showed that this should be eliminated
by high temperature due to the disruption of the highly ordered structure of electrostricted
water.
The solvation of ions in water produces a ∆V = −10ml ·mol−1 whereas the dissociation of
a neutral molecule into ions induces a volume contraction of about −20ml ·mol−1. These
facts confirm that electrostriction is favored by pressure but does not give insights into the
effect on protein stability. Indeed, this phenomenon can have opposite results depending
on the structural effects it produces locally: it can induce denaturation like in the case of
chymotrypsin where pressure produces the dissociation of a salt-bridge in the active site
region bringing the protein reversibly to an inactive state[77]; on the other had, it can also
engender an increase in protein stability if there are weak intersubunit ion-pair interactions
12 general introduction
not exposed to solvent, which may be strengthened by pressure.
❍②❞r♦❣❡♥ ❜♦♥❞s Studies on simple model molecules showed that hydrogen bonds are
stabilized by high pressures up to 4kbar [105, 200]. This results from the smaller inter-atomic
distances in the hydrogen-bonded atoms. The stabilizing effect of pressure on hydrogen
bonding in proteins was first detected by the pressure dependence of the infrared spectra of
the α-helix in myoglobin[127] and from a comparison of the effect on the intermolecular
interactions in hydrogen-bonded versus non-hydrogen-bonded amides[65]. In particular
hydrogen bonds play a fundamental role in the formation of the secondary structure due to
their role in creating the α-helix and β-strand motifs.
It is worth to note also that pressure may promote intermolecular hydrogen bonds at the
expense of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, causing increased conformational fluctuations
[38]. However, a very small if not negligible ∆V value is observed for processes in which
there is an exchange between the existing hydrogen bonds [200, 24].
❍②❞r♦♣❤♦❜✐❝ ✐♥t❡r❛❝t✐♦♥s In general hydrophobic interactions describe the tendencies
of hydrocarbons to form aggregates in the presence of aqueous media. In proteins, they
direct non-polar side chains to the interior of proteins and are a major driving force for
proper folding [110]. In 1959, Kauzmann [109] suggested that the volume changes for the
association of hydrophobic molecules in water should be positive. His hypothesis was based
on the observations made on the large entropic effects of the transfer of hydrocarbons from a
nonpolar solvent to water. Weber et al [207], on the other hand, showed that the association
of aromatic molecules is enhanced by pressure and later Van Eldik et al.[200] confirmed
that interactions that pack aromatic rings parallel to each other engender negative volume
changes. These results give account of two different hydrophobic effects, one related to the
solubility of apolar molecules into water and another one which concerns the solvent-induced
interaction between apolar species.
The former class of hydrophobic effects was initially considered as a good model (called
oil-drop model)[7] for protein folding as it was confirmed by works on thermal denaturation
but could not be confirmed by the pressure effects on protein unfolding because the volume
change upon unfolding is positive at low pressures but negative at pressures of about 1-2
kbar. The transfer of hydrocarbons into water shows exactly the opposite behavior, with ∆V
being negative at low pressures and positive at high pressures[110].
1.1 effects of pressure and temperature on proteins 13
The major role in pressure effects in protein denaturation is commonly attributed to the
hydration of hydrophobic cores. Indeed, the presence of solvent around the proteins gives a
significant importance to the cavities created by the imperfect packing of protein structure.
Solvents, and in particular water, can often enter these void volume areas and come into
contact with inner regions, destabilizing the hydrophilic/hydrophobic equilibrium which
maintained the protein’s stability. Due to its higher compressibility compared to proteins,
water under pressure can also assume local ordering that can easily cause an important
increase in the density of hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, which in turn enhance the
hydrophilic properties of those amino acids that are able to produce hydrogen bonds [213].
Although several works confirmed this essential role of hydrophobic interactions, discrepan-
cies in experimental [74, 139, 138] and theoretical [87] results on how their role in protein
folding/unfolding is accomplished, have not yet allowed the acceptance of the ’oil-drop’
model as a common framework for the interpretation of the different physico-chemical
contributions to the related volume variations [168].
It is worth to note here the work by Hummer et al. [87] which proposed a different role of
hydrophobic interactions in temperature and pressure-induced denaturations. They suggested
that pressure denaturation corresponds to the infiltration of water into the protein, whereas
heat denaturation corresponds to the transfer of nonpolar side-chain groups into water. As a
consequence, pressure denaturation processes lead to (partially or totally) unfolded protein
structures with reduced compactness which are, however, considerably more ordered than
those in heat-denatured proteins, as probed by NMR experiments of hydrogen exchange
[218].
In the context of hydrophobic interactions, it is well established that a significant contribution
is made by the van der Waals (VDW) forces [153, 187, 42]. The effects of pressure on VDW
forces present the same contradictory results as hydrophobic interactions in general, which
does not permit a simple framework to be defined for their physical interpretation. From a
general point of view, VDW forces are likely to be enhanced by pressure since they tend to
maximize the packing density of proteins and thus reduce the volume. Indeed, packing density
is maximized by VDW interactions because the dipole moment attractions they produce
improve the packing of the hydrophobic core [67, 95]. On the other hand, VDW forces can
also contribute to protein destabilization under pressure. In particular for oligomeric proteins,
pressure below 3 kbar promotes the replacement of some weak non-covalent interactions
between amino acid residues with amino acid-water interactions causing changes in peptide
14 general introduction
chain conformations and resulting in dissociation [180]. These protein-water interactions are
promoted by pressure because they produce stronger and shorter bonds that decrease the
overall volume [144, 180].
❈♦♠♣r❡ss✐❜✐❧✐t② The atomic density in proteins is similar to that in solids and can
even exceed the latter locally [87] which makes proteins very insensitive to compression.
Most of the data available on protein compressibility are obtained by sound velocimetry
measurements and the volume change usually observed is around 1% of the protein’s total
volume[60]. Such a small volumetric variation is induced only by the weak interactions we
presented earlier in this section and does not receive any contribution from covalent bonds
in the protein backbone [206]. The major effect is due to the hydrophobic interactions: the
higher the hydrophobic content is in a protein, the more the latter is compressible [180].
A significant role in compressibility is played by the effects of pressure on the hydration. In
particular, as stated in the previous paragraph, the infiltration of water molecules into void
cavities produces a significant change in the local atomic fluctuations which results in the
destabilization of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic equilibrium of the protein. In general the
cavities filled by the solvent can act as two-ways-valves or one-way-valves, depending on the
local molecular environment in the protein [133], i.e. they can form volumes that solvent
molecules can continuously enter or leave or they can instead incorporate water molecules,
separating them from the bulk solvent. These two type of behavior engender differences in
compressibility of cavities and in the whole protein structure [39].
In contrast to temperature, pressure does not seem to have a uniform effect all over the
protein [61]. A molecular simulation study by Paci and Marchi [148] proved that short
distances are rather less compressed than longer one. This was also confirmed by x-ray
experiments performed by Kundrot et al. [121] which showed that side-chains in lysozyme
have a larger response to pressure than backbone.
The physical origin of this heterogeneity in structural response to pressure has been explained
by a phenomenological model of non-covalent interactions where each pairwise interaction
in the protein’s native structure was replaced by an effective harmonic force with a distance
dependent force constant. Interestingly the short-ranged interactions were characterized by
effective force constants larger than long-ranged ones [82, 80], meaning that the former are
stronger and less compressible than the latter.
1.1 effects of pressure and temperature on proteins 15
pressure impact on protein structure levels To summarize, we can conclude
from the previous section that a protein’s reaction to pressure increase is often due to
a complex balancing of opposite effects which tend to combine differently at different
pressures. The effects on the interactions that determine the internal protein structure, have
consequences on all the levels of structural organization (i.e. on secondary, tertiary and
quaternary structures). In the following, we report schematically these repercussions on each
level with reference to the experimental techniques which were used to detect them.
◗✉❛t❡r♥❛r② str✉❝t✉r❡ is mainly maintained by hydrophobic interactions and for this rea-
son it is the most sensitive to pressure. As mentioned in the previous section, moderate
pressure below 1.5kbar favours dissociation of oligomeric proteins [180] which results in
very large and negative volume changes. Sometimes pressure-induced dissociation leads
to formation of individual non-denaturated subunits, as in the case of tryptophane syn-
thethase at 1.5kbar[149], but more frequently it is followed by subsequent conformational
changes in individual subunits[150]. When quaternary structure is maintained by either
pressure-insensitive interactions like hydrogen-bonds or by pressure-enhanced interactions
like aromatic clustering (due to hydrophobic interaction), dissociation can appear also at
pressures higher than 3kbar [132].
Pressure effects on quaternary structure are usually investigated by electrophoresis, ultracen-
trifugation [152], fluorescence spectroscopy[180] and NMR spectroscopy[100].
❚❡rt✐❛r② str✉❝t✉r❡ can be irreversibly changed by pressures above 2kbar. However, some-
times reversible denaturation can be found also at pressure between 4 and 8kbar[171]. This
shows that the volume changes are not completely dominated by hydrophobic interactions
but that other type of weak interactions can also play an important role. An important feature
of pressure denaturation is the formation of a molten globule in which proteins, even though
retaining their intact secondary structure, change their tertiary structure adopting conforma-
tions with hydrodynamic radii 10-20% higher than that of the native state[154]. For the studies
of the tertiary structure changes induced by pressure, the more frequently used methods are
NMR spectroscopy, X-ray, UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy[121, 180, 100].
❙❡❝♦♥❞❛r② str✉❝t✉r❡ undergoes significant changes at very high pressure, above 3-7kbar.
These changes, in contrast to those that affect tertiary structure result always in non-reversible
protein denaturation. Indeed, such pressures induce a high compression of protein
structure resulting in the rupture of hydrogen bonds, which play a major role in the
16 general introduction
formation of secondary elements like α-helices and β-sheets [211]. As regards the secondary
structure, one of the most suitable methods to detect changes is Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR)spectroscopy which gives insights into the protein vibrational spectra where the band
corresponding to the vibration of C=O bond of the amide group is easily detectable. The latter
is very sensitive to the conformation of the polypeptide. Another technique frequently used
to detect changes in secondary structure is circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy which can
rapidly give the percentage of α-helices, β-strands and random-coil in a protein solution [196].
The fact that every pressure range affects roughly only one structure level makes this
physical variable a rather better tool to investigate protein structure stability than any other
perturbation like temperature or pH changes.
1.2 organisms adapted to extreme environments
Organisms are integrated entities, not collections of discrete objects 2
While in the previous section the general effects of pressure and temperature on
proteins were presented, here I want to focus on the particular aspect of the chemical and
physical properties of proteins from organisms which live under extreme conditions. More
precisely, a special case of extreme environment, the warm deep-sea, in which both high
pressure and high temperature can be found, will be presented. Furthermore, inspired
by the phrase that opens this section, I want to point out the fact that the study of
protein molecular adaptation to extreme environments could be highly improved by
the knowledge of the framework of the whole-cell adaptation. Although this section is
intended to be an introduction to the subject of the biology of extreme environments, it is
inevitably incomplete and mainly reflects the personal view and interests of the author. Many
more aspects are described in a number of excellent reviews [85, 93, 182, 158, 107, 151, 191, 58].
The biosphere, i.e. the surface of the earth known to host life, ranges from the abyssal
region of the deep sea to the heights of the Himalaya and shows a wide range of example of
adaptation to ’extreme’ environments. From a quantitative point of view, physical limits to
life today known are the following3[92]:

1.2 organisms adapted to extreme environments 17
• −40◦C < T < 115◦C
• P < 1.2kbar
• ∼ 1 < pH < 11
In the previous section we have discussed the effects of pressure on proteins structure,
here we want to recall some critical effects of temperature on biological chemistry: i) at 100
◦C thermal degradation outruns biosynthesis[92, 95]; ii) at 110-140 ◦C hydrophobic hydration
effects in protein vanish [92]; iii) and at 150 ◦C amino acids start to fall apart [141, 140].
These are obviously the extreme boundaries that do not permit life developing but their
knowledge is useful to understand the increasing effects that organisms have to face when
approaching these limits. From an evolutionary point of view, this means that organisms
should have to find a way to compensate these effects.Hence, organisms which became
extremophiles [167] found some mechanisms to protect themselves against the chemical and
physical damages induced by the environment.
Little is known on how this is accomplished[90, 49] but presumably two parallel strategies
are followed: the first one is the compensation of degrading processes made through a tuning
of the synthesis rate of biomolecules that would be compatible with the average lifetime
of the molecules [92]; the second one is the incorporation of point mutations in protein
sequences in order to increase their structural stability, resulting in a longer lifetime and thus
a longer time of functioning[93].
Nevertheless, this strategy adopted in molecular adaptation does not seem to engender
significant differences between the global distribution of amino acids in mesophile proteins,
i.e. obtained from ’normal’ organisms, as compared to the extremophile ones. Deckert et
al. showed, for example, that the distribution of amino acids contents in mesophilic and
thermophilic proteomes, even though not identical, do not present any significant differences
that could lead to a simple method to distinguish them [48].
As a consequence, adaptation of biomolecules seems to be related exclusively to dif-
ferent local patterns in amino acids sequences resulting in a reorganization of the weak
non-convalent interactions that govern protein stability and flexibility[147, 94]. The new deal
for the stability of extremophile proteins is thus played by the re-organization of mechanisms
that are, as we have seen in the previous paragraphs, sensitive to environmental changes;
they are for example: increased number of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, improved core
18 general introduction
packing, shorter and/or tighter surface loops, enhanced secondary structure propensities, or
oligomerization[134, 135, 136].
From a physical point of view, a first quantitative experimental measure of protein stability
can be made by means of differences in the Gibbs free energy, ∆G(T ,P,N), between the more
stable global minimum and its nearest minima. Jaenicke and Böhm [96] showed that mesophile
and extremophile proteins share ∆G of the same order of magnitudes (∼ 50kJmol−1) even
though extremophiles may show a variability in the range 10− 100kJmol−1. The difference
between the typical values for mesophilic proteins and the variation found in extremophilic
ones correspond to the energy of a few non-covalent interactions and confirm the significant
role the latter play in molecular adaptation[157, 147, 151, 158].
The central issue in the adaptation of biomolecules remains, however, the conservation
of biological functionality which means a well-balanced compromise between stability
and flexibility[197, 92]. Hence, the process of adaptation has to translate the properties
of mesophilic proteins toward the relative extreme conditions which means towards physio-
logical conditions that make molecular properties of extremophilic counterparts very similar
[93]. This translation is perfomed by a re-organization of non-covalent interactions. Several
experiments have provided evidence for this process [217] and showed that dynamical prop-
erties of some mesophilic enzymes at temperature of 25◦C are very similar to those of their
extremophilic homologues at 70◦C. Analogous results were obtained on rubredoxin by a
molecular dynamics study [69].
In this context Jaenicke [93] proposed that molecular adaptation to extreme environments
should tend to maintain corresponding states between respective native environments, which
take into account overall topology, flexibility and hydration of proteins. Even though this idea
found confirmation by experiments in the past, recent works seem to not entirely confirm it
[158].
1.3 the warm deep-sea environment
In contrast to common opinion, terrestrial environments, where the ambient pressure is 1bar,
occupy only the 1% of the total volume of the biosphere. A large fraction of the earth’s surface
(70%) is covered by oceans which have an average depth of 3800 meters and thus an average
ambient pressure of 380 bar4. More than 60% of the marine component of the biosphere is

lithostatic pressure.
1.3 the warm deep-sea environment 19
below 1000m 5. Life below this depth, which is usually defined as the upper boundary of
the "deep sea", has to face several unfavourable conditions such as high pressure (from 1 to
1.1kbar) or temperature (from 1 to 110◦C) 6 which have strong impact to life mechanisms.
After the pioneering studies of Certes in 1884 [30, 29] which helped to establish the
existence of microorganisms in deep sea sediments, the first systematic studies of ZoBell and
Johnson[220], gave the birth in 1949 to a new research line which helped, during the last
century, to better understand the survival strategies employed by organisms to face extreme
conditions.
It allowed for example to elucidate the different adaptation to pressure in several groups
of microorganisms which can be divided into two distinct groups: barophiles (or piezophiles)
which are micro-organisms that possess optimal growth rates at pressures above atmospheric
pressure, whereas barotolerant (or piezotolerant) microorganisms are capable of growth at
high pressure, as well as at atmospheric pressure, but can be distinguished from piezophiles
because they do not have optimal growth rates at pressures above one atmosphere.
Both groups of microorganisms can also be distinguished from piezosensitive ones, whose
growth is sensitive to elevated pressure, because they can grow at 50 MPa at a rate that
is above 30% of their growth rate at atmospheric pressure [107, 108]. Moreover, from a
molecular point of view, barotolerant organisms differentiate themselves from normal
piezosentive ones by the production of some "pressure-shock" proteins induced as reponse to
high pressure environment [97]. These proteins have some equivalents in the "heat-shock"
proteins found in organisms which undergo thermal stress [67, 174] but their mechanism is
far from being completely understood.
In late 70s, the first colonies of "deep-sea" organisms were found also near the hydrothermal
vents[8]. The latter are warm currents which form where freshly extruded lava contracts
upon cooling and allows seawater to penetrate in the newly formed crust of basaltic rocks.
Seawater is then expulsed, highly enriched in heavy metals, creating hot vents which
significantly change the temperature in the nearby area [98].
Obviously the life of organisms near hydrothermal vents became very rapidly the most
intriguing subject in the deep-sea biology and de facto most of the barophilic organisms
known today are also thermophilic which means that they have been proven to also have
greater growth rates at high temperatures (typically from 50 to 90◦C) than at usual deep-sea
5 The greatest depth in oceans, in the Mariana Trench is near 11000 meters whereas the deepest floor found in
freshwaters is at 1632 meters in the Lake Baikal

only until 300 meters of depth
20 general introduction
temperatures ( around 2◦C) [1].
This environment, usually called the warm deep-sea, introduced several interesting ques-
tions from a biological and evolutionary point of view which demanded also new explanation
from biochemistry and physics.
pathways of adaptation to warm deep-sea environments Before focusing on
some aspects of the molecular adaptation of proteins to this environment, here some well
known facts about the whole-cell adaptation are reported schematically, for they play a
fundamental role in defining the general framework in which all molecular results should be
interpreted. The main features of biological adaptation to high hydrostatic pressure are[182]:
Adaptation to pressure allows deep-living species to thrive under high pressure but it
can also reduce their ability to live at moderate depths. This means that deep-living
species are usually barophilic and not barotolerants[179].
Common patterns of adaptation appear in widely different types of deep-sea
organisms[179].
Most of the physiological and biochemical processes which are in general found to
be pressure-sensitive in normal organisms, are rather stable under high pressure in
deep-living ones and exhibit, at in situ temperatures and pressures, values similar to
those found in terrestrail or shallow-living organisms at 1bar pressure[41, 44].
Species living in deep sea hydrothermal vents show that adaptation to both temperature
and pressure are essential for cellular growth and physiological function. This means
that adaptation to high pressure does not pre-adapt organisms from cold deep sea to the
environment typical of the hydrothermal vents[182, 45].
While the first three points seem to confirm the idea of the existence of corresponding states
between mesophilic and extremophilic organisms, the last point reveals the fundamental
interplay of pressure and temperature in warm deep-sea environments. This means, however,
that evolution has to cope with complex superpositions of parameters which are difficult to
separate and renders impossible the definition of strategies of molecular adaptation.
1.3 the warm deep-sea environment 21
In an extremely simplified view, the complex mechanism which governs the life of a cell
can be schematically divided in two parts: protein synthesis, which furnishes all the "tools"
(the proteins) necessary for the cell machinery to work; and cellular metabolism, which
includes all the process that constitute the cellular life itself.
Following this scheme, we present the principal properties of protein adaptation to a warm
deep-sea environment, focusing on proteins that participate in the cellular metabolism and
those which have a role in other protein synthesis.
Enzymes, by their role as catalysts and regulators of metabolism, are the mediators by
which living systems function and reproduce. Somero et al [183] proposed that the successful
adaptation of an organism entering the deep sea would require the maintenance of the
same balance of enzyme synthesis, catalytic activity, and regulation as its surface-living
counterparts. Indeed, from several studies of enzymatic functions of deep-living organisms, a
few convergent common properties were found [130, 98]: i) the preservation of an enzyme’s
capacity to bind substrates under deep-sea conditions is essential in adapting metabolism
to that environment; ii) structural changes induced at pressures as low as 50-100 bar may
modify enzyme function sufficiently to induce evolutional selection for pressure insensitivity;
and finally iii) the capacity of an enzyme to function independently of pressure is acquired at
the cost of a reduction in catalytic efficiency.
Furthermore, in the context of the combined adaptation to temperature and pressure, it is
worth noting that for several hydrogenase enzymes from widely different warm deep-sea
organisms, pressure was found to significantly increase their thermal stability [45, 188]. This
type of enzyme undergoes large conformational change and hydration during its activity and
this makes them particularly well suited for investigating the effects of pressure.
In general for deep-sea organisms from the hydrothermal vents, the stabilization of catalytic
proteins was often found as the result of some point mutations in primary sequences
whose outcome could either be the increase of the size of the hydrophobic core and
its compactness (essentially substitutions with hydrophobic amino acids with larger
side-chains), the augmentation of hydrogen bonds (substituiting lysine with arginines ) or
the reduction/deletion of amino acids with side-chains sensitive to high temperatures (
asparagines, glutamines, cysteines and tryptophane) [142].
Protein synthesis is ideally divided into two steps: transcription, in which the genetic code
is copied from DNA to a RNA messenger (mRNA); and translation where peptides are bound
22 general introduction
together with the help of ribosomes and where genetic code in mRNA is decoded into amino
acids sequences. Both process are found to be highly sensitive to pressure [124].
Early studies investigating the effects of pressure on E. coli revealed that an essentially
complete cessation of protein synthesis occurred at growth-inhibiting pressures of 680 atm
[67]. Subsequent comparison of protein synthesis of E. coli and known barotolerant organisms
permitted the barotolerance properties to be associated to the activity of ribosome [124] and
in particular to its 30S subunit [125].
Indeed, ribosomes are made of two subunits (a smaller and a larger one) which are capable
of associating and dissociating. As we will discuss later in the text, this phenomenon is
important because the initiation of protein synthesis requires free ribosomal subunits in order
to allow the formation of a complex containing the mRNA anchored to the small subunit
before the joining of the large subunit. The ribosome’s subunit association is known to be a
rate-limiting process in the protein synthesis [162] and was found to be inhibited at elevated
hydrostatic pressures in mesophilic organisms [185].
This effect was previously discussed as a possible reason for the inhibition of protein synthesis
and, hence, of cell growth by hydrostatic pressure [91] but later more sophisticated in vitro
studies showed that ribosomal complexes retain their "associated" state over the whole range
of biologically relevant pressures [68]. Other studies on ribosomes from mesophilic organisms
showed that association can be regulated also by temperature which usually enhances the
association equilibrium towards the associated species[83, 184]. Interestingly, these results
show that under estimated physiological conditions in several eukaryotes, ribosomes are
present almost exclusively in their associated form. The cell must therefore possess some
mechanisms for maintaining a pool of free ribosomal subunits. These mechanisms have to
account for protein synthesis inhibition under extreme conditions. Unfortunately, very little
is known about the differences between the protein synthesis machinery of extremophiles
and mesophiles.
methanococcus jannaschii This thesis will focus on a protein produced by an
archaeon7 microbe living near the hydrothermal vents, Methanococcus Jannaschii. This
organism, discovered in 1963 as a "methane-producer" [102], usually lives at temperatures
ranging from 48 to 94 ◦C with an optimum temperature at 85◦C and at pressures of more
than 200 bar (in situ depth 2600 meters).
7 The archaea are known as a primitive form of life significantly different from both prokaryots and eukaryotes.
For this reason is often referred to as the third domain of life.
1.4 the anti-association factor 23
M Jannaschii’s genome was the first archaeon genome to be completely sequenced [18]
and revealed the complex evolutionary relationships between archaea and eukaryotes and
bacteria: only less than an half of the genes found in its genome could be matched to those
of other organisms. In the context of this thesis work, from a molecular biology point of
view, the most interesting feature of this organism is that while sharing the same protein
biosynthesis machinery (both transcription and translation) as eukaryotes, it does also have
genes homologous to both eukaryotes and bacteria for the initiation part of the translation
process. The latter is a fundamental and rate-limiting part of the translation and will be
discussed more deeply in the next section.
It has been shown that M Jannaschii’s metabolism and growth at high temperatures are
enhanced by pressure up to 750 bar whereas the upper limit for growth is 90◦C either
under low or high pressure [102]. These results suggested that M.Jannaschii is effectively a
barophilic organism and not just barotolerant. The finding seemed to be confirmed by studies
on enzymatic reaction: it was shown that application of 500 bar increased the thermal half-life
of hydrogenase from M. jannaschii 4.8-fold at 90 ◦C ◦C [74] and increased the half-life of a
protease from the same organism 2.7-fold at 125 ◦C [138]. Nevertheless, recent works showed
that pressure inhibits the 20S proteasome function from M Jannaschii [55], suggesting that in
some cases lower protein activity at the in situ pressure could be a regulatory mechanism
that confers some advantage to the whole cell. Hence, a more complex behaviour of the cell
response to high pressure and high temperature should be envisaged.
1.4 the anti-association factor
In the following we want to give a short introduction to the protein studied in this thesis,
which is called the Anti-Association Factor[170, 199]. A complete description of the molecular
biology background which is necessary to introduce the function of this protein, would
be largely out of the scope of this thesis and we limit our discussion to the essential key points.
The anti-association factor belongs to the familiy of initiation factors and is usually also
called initiation factor 6. In the following, in order to maintain a coherence with the cited most
recent bibliographic references, I will call it by the short name IF6 sometimes preceded by a
prefix indicating the domain of life from which it comes: eIF6, for eukaryotic initiation factor
24 general introduction
6, pIF6 for its prokaryotic counterpart and aIF6 for the archaeon one.
IF6, like the other initiation factors, takes part in the first steps of the translation process.
Translation initiation can be subdivided into three steps: first, binding of the specific initiator
Met-tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit; second, binding of the resulting complex to a
mRNA and locating the initiation codon; and third, joining of the large ribosomal subunit
to generate a translation competent ribosome. All these steps are facilitated by soluble
proteins termed translation initiation factors, and the structures of many of them have been
characterized at the atomic level. It is worth noting that while the essential part of this process
is shared by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the process itself is decidedly more complex
in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes and in part reflects the fact that much of the regulation in
prokaryotes is via the coupling of transcription and translation. Such coupling is not possible
in eukaryotes as transcription occurs in the nucleus while translation occurs in the cytoplasm.
The eukaryotic initiation factors can be divided into two groups: those that bind and
operate on ribosomal particles promoting subunit dissociation and association, initiator
Met-tRNA binding, and mRNA binding; and those that are aimed at mRNA and engaged in
preparing its upstream region for initiation. The first group contains the factors analogous to
prokaryotic pIF1, pIF2 and pIF3, namely eIF1 ( and eIF1A), eIF2 and eIF3 respectively, as
well as several additional factors, such as eIF2B, eIF5 and eIF6. The second group seems to
have no analogs in prokaryotes and includes special mRNA-binding and mRNA-unwinding
proteins facilitating initiation of translation; these are the factors of eIF4 group, namely eIF4A,
eIF4B, eIF4F and eIF4E [186].
The role of IF6 in the translation initiation is more complex than those of the other initiation
factors because it engenders different functions about which very little is known. First of all,
IF6 does not act as a true initiation factor because it does not form any initiation complex8
either with RNAs and ribosome subunits as proved by the fact that yeast cells depleted of
eIF6 remained active in translation of mRNAs in vitro [178]. Its principal functions can be
resumed as follows:
- it is required for biogenesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit both in archaebacteria and
eukaryotes [173, 178, 177, 212]
8 Initiation complexes are macromolecular complexes formed by mRNA, tRNA and ribosome subunits which
come together to form the machinery that perform the first two steps of the translation. IF6 does not take part
directly into this mechanism.
1.4 the anti-association factor 25
- it acts as de facto anti-association factor of the 60S and 40S subunit in the cytoplasm
[178, 28]
Moreover, a very recent work also uncovered another evolutionary conserved function
of IF6 in the microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional silencing[34] which could extend
significantly the peculiarities of IF6.
Si and Maitra showed that depletion of eIF6 in yeast cells resulted first in a decrease in
the rate of protein synthesis and then in cessation of cell growth [178] and Basu et al. [10]
showed also that the protein depletion caused in cells a selective reduction of 60S ribosomal
subunits. These two results and the previous one confirmed the evolutionarily conserved
main role of IF6 in biogenesis and assembly of ribosomal units and also the absence of its
direct participation into the translation process.
The suggestion of these two functions of IF6 is also strengthened by the localization of
the protein in both nucleus and cytoplasm[6] where ribosome subunit biogenesis and
ribosome assembly take place respectively. Furthermore, Basu and coworkers [10] showed
that phosphorylation of eIF6 regulates its distribution in nucleus and cytoplasm [11].
As a whole, the multiple functions of IF6 make of this protein an essential factor for cellular
growth and protein synthesis. Very little is known about its participation in the 60S biogenesis
whereas several works in the past decades better elucidated its role of anti-association factor
at a molecular level [28]. This function has been identified in eukaryotes as part of process
which involves a protein promoter of ribosome translation, RACK1 and a protein kinase PKC.
In the context of this work, it is worth noting that eIF6 has been proven to be very sensitive
to heat: in homologues from wheat germ [170] and calf liver[199], eIF6 activity had an
optimum at around 37◦C but was completely abstent between 50 and 60◦C. Whether the
cessation of activity is due to a partial or complete protein denaturation is not known.
From a molecular point of view, IF6s are 26kDa proteins which share a phylogenetically
conserved sequence of 224 residues with 30% similarity. All known eukaryotic IF6 contain
an additional carboxyl terminal extension of 21 amino acids. Even though this tail does
not seem to be directly involved to the anti-association function of IF6[66], as proved in
in vitro reactions, it has been proven to be somehow related to this process through the
26 general introduction
phosphorylation of a serine residue (Ser235) by the protein kinase PKC [28].
In 2000, the first molecular structure of an IF6 homologues was resolved by x-ray
crystallography by Groft and coworkers [66] who obtained the structures of two homologous
IF6s issued from M.Jannaschii and from Saccharomyces ceraevisie. Both structures revealed a
very unusual internal pseudo-symmetry made by the disposition around a common axis of
five copies of a repeating α/β subdomain of about 45 residues. Each subdomain contains: one
long α helix, a shorter α-helix or a 310-helix and three β-strands. While the global structure
of the first 224 residues is well known and has been proven to be evolutionarily conserved by
homology modelling [66], nothing is known about the structure of the C-terminal extension
of 21 amino acids.
Figure 7: Cartoon representation of IF6 backbone. The color scheme highlights different type of protein
secondary structure. One of the pseudo-subdomain is shown on the left-hand side as
reference.
1.5 the thesis project "at a glance". 27
From a structural point of view is also worth-noting the fact that the five subdomains do
not make a unified hydrophobic center of the protein. Instead, they produce an hydrophobic
"torus" by their association which in turn creates a cave-like hollow in the center of the
structure. The cavity is large enough to let water molecules enter and in the crystallographic
data sixteen of them were found in a well-ordered conformation of pentagonal layers and are
hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of two residues in the neighboring β-strands.
In the yeast (Saccharomyces ceraevisie) eIF6 this cavity is closed by an arginine (residue 61)
whose guanidinium group makes several hydrogen bonds with glycines in the short α-helix
of subdomains.
1.5 the thesis project "at a glance".
As stated earlier in this introduction, the key point for molecular evolution is the maintain of
biological function. This is accomplished in proteins either by point mutations or by simple
structure re-arrangements. Nonetheless, evolution does not have a unique pathway to follow
this procedure.
This thesis focused on the way proteins evolutionarily "react" to large environmental
changes, i.e. how they adapt to function even in organisms which live in extreme conditions.
Following this idea, this work concentrated on the study of the adaptation of the IF6 from
Methanococcus Jannaschii to extreme environments. In this context the comparison with
proteins in normal (mesophilic) conditions would have been essential to finely characterize
the ability to adapt to extremes conditions.
IF6s from Saccaromyces cerevisiae was chosen as mesophilic counterpart of Methanococcus
Jannaschii. They share only 33% of identity in sequence but their structures are significantly
similar to each other and to most of the other IF6s homologues [66]. As a whole, this means
that IF6’s function was highly conserved during evolution but it does not explain how
function and, apparently, structure have been maintained in the adaptation to a wide variety
of environmental conditions.
In this context, the work presented here will try to give a first answer to the following
questions:
Where does the extremophilic signature come from ?
If structure cannot be the origin for this, can it be the dynamics??
28 general introduction
Of course all answers given here will be limited to the particular case of adaptation to the
warm deep-seas and will not be neither exhaustive nor general but could introduce a new
approach in study of protein evolution.
The main tools used in this work are molecular dynamics simulation and neutron
scattering experiments. After a brief introduction to the main concepts of the theoretical
frameworks that guided this work, the experimental setups will be presented.
In the following chapter a wide and detailed presentation of a novel method for the
characterization of the protein secondary structure is given. The method, called ScrewFit, was
developped in the context of this thesis but it has rapidly found some different applications
of the analysis of protein structures. Some examples already published as scientific articles in
international peer-reviwed journals will be given.
Finally the results of this work on IF6 homologues will be presented and discussed. Some
general outcomes will be then used in the tentative of giving answers to the questions about
protein evolution proposed above.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1 molecular dynamics
2.1.1 The basic principle
Molecular simulations used in combination with experimental methods, are a very
useful tool to give new insights into the dynamics and structure of complex molecular
systems. Simulation methods are used within different approximations, depending on the
experimental results with which they are confronted.
In this sense, neutron scattering techniques are well matched to molecular dynamics
simulation (MD) method which combines the classical equations of motions with empirical
force fields obtained from a priori quantum-dynamical calculations of atomic interactions
in the building blocks of the systems of interest. The basic approximation made in MD
is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation which states that due to the large difference in
masses between electrons and atomic nuclei, the electron dynamics is orders of magnitude
faster than that of the nuclei and, therefore, it can be assumed that electronic shells adapt
instantaneously to the positions of the nuclei. Moreover the dynamics of the nuclei is treated
by classical mechanics.
De facto, the MD gives information about the dynamics of the same objects that are directly
seen by neutrons: the atomic nuclei. As a consequence, MD and neutron scattering give
access to the same length and time scales (ranging from 1 Åto 100 Åand from 0.1ps to 10ns,
respectively).
In an MD simulation each atom is represented by a point mass whose dynamics is described
by the classical Newton’s equations of motion:
mir¨ = Fi, i = 1, . . . ,N (2.1)
29
30 material and methods
where mi is the mass of atom i and Fi is the total force acting it. The force Fi is derived
from the potential energy U(r1 . . . rN) through:
∂U(r1 . . . rN)
Fi = − (2.2)
∂ri
As already mentioned, the energy U(r1 . . . rN) is an effective energy which describes all
types of atomic interactions. The generic form of the potential energy is :

The terms of this potential can be divided into two groups: bonded interactions, which are
related to the covalent bond structure taking into account the stretching of bond lengths, the
bending of bond angles and dihedral angles described by three consecutive bonds; non-bonded
interactions describe the repulsion between neighboring atoms, the dispersive forces due to
mutually induced atomic dipoles (both contained in a Lennard-Jones 12-6 function) and
electrostatic interactions.
Throughout this thesis all molecular dynamics simulations have been performed using the
AMBER9 simulation program [26]. The whole set of simulations used the AMBER99SB force
field which is a recent upgraded version of the AMBER94 force field, usually used for protein
molecular dynamics, and which contains a reparametrization of the backbone torsion terms
and achieves a better balance of the different secondary structure elements [86].
MD simulations of biological molecules are mostly performed in solution, typically
water, as in real biological environments. In order to obtain a realistic solvation of the
sample molecule, the amount of solvent molecules is usually very large and counts for a
2.1 molecular dynamics 31
substantial part of the computational effort. Several simple models for water molecules
have been developed in the past which allow simulations to be performed with a moderate
computational cost. A simple and widely used model is the TIP3P model [103, 104]. Here
the molecule has a rigid geometry with fixed bond lengths and angles; the intermolecular
interactions are modeled by Coulombic and Lennard-Jones terms. Moreover, the model
contains three sites for the electrostatic interactions: the partial positive charge of hydrogens
is balanced by a negative charge placed at the oxygen atom position; the van der Waals
interactions are computed with only one point of interaction per molecule, centered on the
oxygen atoms.
The set of ordinary differential equations (2.1) is solved numerically using a discretization
method. The general procedure can be summarized as follows. Given the initial dynamic state
(position and velocities) at time t, the positions and velocities at time t+∆t are calculated.
The finite time-step ∆t depends on the integration method as well as on the system itself. The
basic criteria for a good integrator are: it should be fast, require little computer memory and
be time-reversible; it should permit the use of a relatively long time step and guarantee the
conservation of the total energy within a reasonable error which is related to the definition of
the time step ∆t. For later analysis one assumes also the ergodicity of the simulated trajectory,
i.e. if A is a function of time then
∫
1 T
lim∞ A(τ)dτ = 〈A〉T→ T 0
where T is the simulation length and 〈·〉 a phase space ensemble average. This condition
allows the calculation of the ensemble averages by means of time averages.
periodic boundary conditions and summation of non-bonded terms A
real experiment relates to macroscopic samples consisting of ≈ 1023 atoms whereas the
simulated systems usually contains between 103 to 106 atoms. This discrepancy leads to
significant differences in physical quantities of the bulk, due to a larger influence of boundary
effects in the simulated systems. For this reason, periodic boundary conditions are applied:
the initial unit cell is replicated infinitely in all directions, meaning that each atom i having
position ri = (xi,yi, zi) in the central box has an infinite number of image atoms with
32 material and methods
Figure 8: Bidimensional representation of the periodic boundary condition
positions ri + niL = (xi + n1L,yi + n2L, zi + n3L) where L is the linear dimension of the
simulation box (assuming a cubic shape) and the integer triples n = (n1,n2,n3)define the
direction in space. From a practical point of view, this means that during the simulation,
whenever an atom leaves the principal simulation box, it enters again from the opposite side
thus keeping the average density of the system constant.
When calculating the force acting on an atom of the system, one should consider both the
interactions with the other N− 1 atoms and those with all images lying in the surrounding
box. This would lead to a sum of infinite terms which is clearly not possible in practice. For
this reason, it is assumed that each atom interacts only with the nearest images of all other
atoms. In this approach, called the minimum image convention, the distance between the pair
of atoms i, j is defined by dij = minn{||rj + nL− ri|}, i.e. the distance between atom i and the
closest image of atom j. The outcome of this convention is that the calculation of potential
energy and forces would involve only 1/2N(N− 1) terms.
For short-ranged interactions, such as Lennard-Jones ones, the list of atoms interacting with
atom i can be restricted to its neighboring pairs taking a cut-off distance which is usually
set lower than L/2, where L is the linear dimension of the box, in order to ensure that each
atom is counted only once. Nevetheless, this truncation of potential energy calculation can be
safely applied only to the short-ranged forces. The long-ranged forces, i.e. the electrostatic
ones, cannot be calculated within this approach because they contribute significantly to the
overall potential also at distances larger than the box dimensions.
2.1 molecular dynamics 33
The periodic boundary conditions can be used also to calculate the electrostatic interactions
between all atoms of the system by means of the Ewald summation method. The term due to
these interactions, when written for periodic systems, must take into account the interactions
between atoms belonging to different periodic images of the original box:
∑′ ∑ qiqj
Uelect = ‖ ‖ (2.4)ǫ r
n ij
+ nL
i6j
where the vectors n = (n1,n2,n3) with n1,n2,n3 = 1, ..∞ are the lattice vectors which
define the periodic images of the original box. This sum is conditionally convergent, i.e. the
results depend on the order in which the terms are summed up. A suitable choice is to sum
boxes in order of their distance from the original one, thus approaching the sum of terms
over spherical layers for which the value of Uelect in equation (2.4) is known. A rapidly
convergent form to this value, can be obtained by the substitution of (2.4) by the sum of two
rapidly convergent series, as originally proposed by Ewald [53, 131].
In the general approach, each point charge in the system is surrounded by a charge
distribution of equal magnitude and opposite sign. The form of this distribution is usually a
Gaussian:
q β3i
ρ(r) = exp(−β2r2) (2.5)
π3/2
This distribution screens the interactions between neighboring charges and summed, over
the periodic system, together with the original point charges, leads to a rapidly convergent
potential which has the form [46, 78]:
∑ erfc(β|r+ n|)
φ(r;β) = (2.6)
|r+ n|
n
where erfc is the error function and β is a parameter which affects the rate of convergence
of the series in the direct space of the periodic lattice. Another charge distribution of the
same sign of the original charges and with the same shape of ρ(r) is added to reduce the
overall potential to the one due to the original set of charges. This cancelling distribution is
summed in the reciprocal space of the periodic lattice by means of Fourier transforms. To
correct the fact that the latter series contains also the interaction of each distribution with
itself, a self-term is also added. Finally, another additional term, J(D) is usually added to take
into account the effects due to the dipole moment D of the original box as well as the external
dielectric constant.

The final rapidly convergent potential reads:

∑k 6=0N
√β− q2i + J(D) (2.7)π
i=1
where k defines the reciprocal lattice vectors. The rate of convergence of the series in (2.7) is
determined by the value of β. Adjusting it can significantly improve the computational effort
and transform an initial O(N2) algorithm to an O(N3/2) one (if the system is homogenous).
Further improvements in the efficiency of the algorithm can be achieved by choosing β
sufficiently large that atom pairs for which rij exceeds a specific cut-off distance roff are
negligible in the first series in (2.7), which reduces this term to an O(N) calculation. The sum
in the reciprocal space in the second series of (2.7) can then be approximated by means of
the Fast Fourier Transfom algorithm. The latter algorithm requires a regular discrete grid of
points and for this reason the point charges are mapped onto the neighboring grid points
by means of interpolation. The spacing of the grid significantly affects the accuracy of this
approximation. This improvement of the original Ewald summation is referred to as the
particle-mesh method and has global complexity of order O(N lnN), N being the number of
particles.
Throughout this thesis, periodic boundary conditions were applied for all production
simulations and the electrostatic interactions were computed using the particle-mesh Ewald
method for which the cut-off roff distance in the direct sum was set to 8 Åand the grid for
the term in the reciprocal space had a spacing of 0.75 Åwith an B-spline interpolation upto
the 4th order.
extended ensemble molecular dynamics The MD simulations presented in this
work have been performed to reproduce the environment of experimental setups. For this
purpose, they emulated the condition of constant average temperature and pressure which
2.1 molecular dynamics 35
corresponds to the isothermic-isobaric ensemble, NPT in statistical mechanics. In the case of
MD simulations, this means that the number of particles N in the system is constant and the
value of the temperature T and of the pressure P are instantaneously readjusted toward the
average requested value by the control of some supplementary variables. The latter modify
both the velocities (to adjust the temperature) and the interatomic distances (for pressure
adjustment), introducing additional degrees of freedom in the original equation of motion
(2.1). The following paragraphs give a brief explanation on how these re-adjustements are
performed.
▲❛♥❣❡✈✐♥ t❤❡r♠♦st❛t The macroscopic average temperature is maintained constant by
means of a coupling of the system with a thermal bath at constant temperature which should
work like a real thermostat. In the present work this coupling is achieved by inserting in
Newton equation of motion a friction and a stochastic term. This leads to the equation known
as the Langevin equation and for each atom i reads:
miv(¨t) = Fi − γivi(t) +Ri(t). (2.8)
where Fi is total force applied on atom i, Ri(t) is a stochastic force and γi represents the
intensity of coupling with the thermal bath.
The stochastic term is defined as a white-noise, i.e. its ensemble average must be zero and it is
completely uncorrelated at all times:
〈Ri(t)〉 = 0
〈R (t) ·R (t ′)〉 = 6k Tγ δ (t− t ′i i B i i ) (2.9)
where δ (t− t ′) is the Dirac distribution centered in (t− t ′i ).
The friction term −γivi(t) opposes the motion of atom i affecting its velocity: it is proportional
to the atom velocity and with opposite sign. This term is strictly related to the stochastic force
by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which leads to:
∫
dt〈Ri(t) ·Ri(0)〉 = 6kBTγi. (2.10)
These assumptions have to be made to avoid any memory effect in the values of Ri(t)
which could bring to unreal drift phenomena in velocity values. This method allows to the
36 material and methods
control of the temperature through the mutual balance between the friction and stochastic
terms in adjusting the velocity of each atom. It is worth noting here that Langevin thermostat
allows a correct sampling of the canonical ensemble but a priori the addition of a friction
term in the equation of motion could result in some artifacts in the dynamical properties of
the simulated system. Nevertheless, this problem can be biased using friction coefficients
much smaller than the actual friction coefficient of the solvent. In the case of water which
has γ = 50ps−1 is was shown that a value of 2ps−1 does not significantly change protein
dynamics [195]. Details on the parameter values used in this work are given in the next
chapter.
❇❡r❡♥❞s❡♥ ❇❛r♦st❛t The adjustment of instant pressure values can be approached exactly
in the same way as for temperature, by coupling the system to a pressure bath.
The value of the system pressure is related microscopically to the internal kinetic energy and
the virial:

P = [Ekinetic − Ξ] , (2.11)
3V
where
∑N1
Ξ = − 〈 rij · Fij〉. (2.12)
2
i>j
From these equations it is evident that a change in pressure can be obtained by changing
the virial through the rescaling of the interatomic distances rij. The latter leads to a rescaling
of the total volume of the simulated system and of its atomic coordinates. The method
originally proposed by Berendsen and coworkers [14] uses the rescaling of distances to
regulate the macroscopic pressure of the system. For this purpose the equation that relates
the time derivative of atomic coordinates with velocities, r¨ = v should be modified with the
introduction of an extra term : x¨ = v− αx. The volume of the system should also change
accordingly: V¨ = α3V .
The pressure variation in the pressure bath is defined by:
( )
dP P0 − P
= (2.13)
dt bath τp
2.1 molecular dynamics 37
where P0 is the target pressure value. Additionally, the pressure change is generally also
related to the isothermal compressibility β by:
( )
dP 1 dV 3α

dt T βV dt β
where the last equality is obtained by applying the requested volume re-scaling.
Equations (2.13) and (2.14) leads to:
P0 − P
α = −β (2.15)
3τp
Hence, the equation of motion now reads:
P0 − P
x¨ = v−β x (2.16)
3τp
The solution of this equation, as obtained by the finite difference methods used in MD
simulations gives a rescaling factor for the atom coordinates and the linear dimension of the
simulation box which is equal to (at the first order in the time step ∆t)1:
β∆t
µ = 1− (P0 − P). (2.17)
3τp
leapfrog integrator In the program suite AMBER9, the integration of the equations
of motion for the extended system corresponding to the NPT ensemble used in this work, is
implemented through the use of the Leapfrog integrator [56, 3]. The latter is a symplectic and
time-reversible integrator whose general form is derived by the Taylor series expansion of
Newton equations for the atom position r, at timestep t and for its velocity at an intermediate
time step t+∆t/2 [56]:
1
vi(t+∆t/2) = vi(t−∆t/2) + Fi∆t (2.18)
mi
ri(t+∆t) = ri(t) + vi(t+∆t/2)∆t (2.19)
The velocity vi(t+∆t) can be computed a posteriori with the relation:
1
vi(t) = [vi(t+∆t/2) + vi(t−∆t/2)] (2.20)

When applied to an extended system issued by the use of the Langevin thermal bath and
Berendsen barostat, (2.19) reads:

2.2 neutron scattering
Neutrons are one of the most useful probes to study the structural and dynamical properties
in condensed matter. Neutrons for scattering experiments are usually moderated to be at
thermal equilibrium at room temperature with typical energies of ∼ 25 meV and wavelength
around 1.78Å, which corresponds to the same time and length scale of the thermally excited
atoms motions. These facts make neutrons very sensitive to both amplitude and frequencies
of atomic motions. For macromolecules, cold neutrons which have typical energies around
2.3meV and wavelength ∼ 5Å, are however better adapted to explore longer length scale and
slower dynamics.
Figure 9: Scheme of neutron scattering
Neutrons interact directly with atomic nuclei via a very short range potential which can
be considered as a direct collision between the neutron and a nucleus (see Figure 2.2). An
incident monochromatic neutron beam can interact with matter through both absorption
and scattering. When scattered, neutrons can be characterized by their wave vector kout and
energy Eout [129, 13].
2.2 neutron scattering 39
The number of incident neutrons with wave vector kout which are scattered with a wave
vector kout in the elementary solid angle dΩ around the direction of kout and with an
energy exchange dω is called differential cross section and it is defined as:
d2σ · |kout|= N S(q,ω), (2.23)
dΩdω |kin|
where N is the number of scatterers in the sample.
The function S(q,ω) is called the dynamic structure factor and it gives access to sample
dynamics as a function of q and ω which represent the momentum and the energy transfer
respectively:
∆p = h (kin − kout) = h q (2.24)

The value of  √|q| is related to the energy transfer hω by the relation:√√√ √h ω h ω
|q| = kin 2− − 2 1− cos θ (2.26)
Ein Ein
This formulation of the problem takes into account the fact that in scattering phenomena
neutrons more easily loose energy in interacting with matter. Equation in (2.26) is of crucial
importance for the determination of the accessible range in the experimental settings of
quasielastic neutron scattering measurements.
Linear response theory allows the dynamic structure factor to be written in terms of
equilibrium fluctuations of the sample and thus, using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem
[201], S(q,ω) can be written as the Fourier transform of the intermediate scattering function
F(q, t):

where "〈· · ·〉" denotes an ensemble average and if A(t) and B(t) are two time-dependent
functions, "〈A(t1)B(t2)〉" is usually referred to as a correlation function. The parameter b¸/˛,
called the scattering length, is an effective linear dimension of the nucleus α/β with respect to
its interaction with neutrons. The function G¸˛(r, t) in (2.28) is referred to as the Van Hove
pair correlation function and represents the probability that, given a particle at the origin at
time t = 0, any particle (including the same one) is at r at time t.
The intensities of the neutron-nucleus interactions are defined by the scattering lengths b of
each nucleus in the sample which depend on the isotope and the relative orientation between
the spin of the two interacting particles. If the spins of the nuclei and the neutron are not
maintained in a special orientation one can assume a random relative orientation and that
spin and position of the nuclei are uncorrelated.
For this, F(q, t) in (2.28) takes into account the random distribution of nuclear spins in the
sample through the parameter Γαβ defined in (2.29) where the average over isotopes and
relative spin orientations of neutron and nucleus is expressed by · · ··.
The parameter Γαβ can be divided into two terms:
Γαβ = bα,cohbβ,coh + δαβ(bα,incbα,inc) (2.30)
where,
b√α,coh = bα (2.31)
2 2bα,inc = bα − bα (2.32)
are linked to the total scattering cross section by the relation:
σ = 4π(b2 + b2α α,coh α,inc).
The outcome of equation (2.30) is also that F(q, t) can now be recast as a sum of two parts:
the coherent part Fcoh(q, t) which results from the correlations in time between the positions
of the atom α (autocorrelation term) and those of different atoms β (cross-correlation term);
the incoherent part Finc(q, t) which results only from the time auto-correlation of the positions
of the same atom α:

2.2.1 Incoherent Scattering
Neutron scattering from biological samples is mainly dominated by the incoherent part
of the scattering of the hydrogen nucleus. This fact is due to the large difference between
the incoherent term from hydrogens and the incoherent and coherent terms from the other
isotopes that are usually present in biological samples. This fact is clearly shown in Table
2.2.1

32S 2.80 0 0.99 0
Table 5: Incoherent and coherent scattering lengths of the most common isotopes found in biological
samples. Data reported from [175].
The characteristic cross section of hydrogens is mainly due to a large incoherent
contribution of the most favorable state of the interacting system composed by the incident
neutron and the hydrogen nucleus. From a practical point of view, this fact constitutes a
significant advantage in studying biological samples because they present large amounts of
hydrogens uniformly spread over their chemical components. Therefore, the scattering from
samples will represent the dynamics of the whole molecule even though they are mainly
due to only one type of atom. Moreover, the great difference between the cross section of
hydrogen (1H) and the one of deuterium (2H) allows some contrast to be created between
different parts of the same molecule or between the molecule and the aqueous content of the
surrounding solvent yielding a better characterization of the structure and dynamics of the

sample itself.
Elastic and Quasielastic Incoherent Scattering
A typical spectrum from neutron scattering measurements is shown in Figure (2.2.1) where
one can easily distinguish three different regions: the elastic peak which results from scattering
without exchange of energy between the interacting particles and gives insights into the
structural configuration of the sample; the quasi-elastic part which results from small energy
changes and describes all the stochastic dynamics of atoms in the sample, such as rotational
and translation diffusion; the inelastic part which is present only if the energy change is
sufficient to modify the equilibrium state of the sample and gives access to vibrational
motions.
As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the large quantity of hydrogens in proteins or
DNA lets us perform the following approximation:
F(q, t) ≈ N b2H,inc FH(q, t) (2.35)
where
1 ∑
F (q, t) = 〈eiqT·rα(t) e−iqT·rα(0)H 〉 (2.36)

α∈{H}
The relative dynamic structure factor can be written using the relation (2.27)
∫
1 +∞
S (q,ω) = dtF (q, t)e−iωtH ∞ H , (2.37)2π −
and it is the main part of the dynamic structure factor that can be directly measured by
neutron scattering experiments.
In the case of samples with confined internal motions, such as biological macromolecules,
the intermediate scattering function defined in (2.36) can be decomposed into a time-
dependent part and a time-independent one:
F (q, t) = F ′H H(q, t) + FH(q,∞) (2.38)
2.2 neutron scattering 43
Figure 10: A typical spectrum from neutron scattering measurements.
This is due to the fact that the atom positions at different instants become independent of
time as the latter goes to infinity.
In simple liquids, where any confined motion is present, the time-independent term is strictly
zero because of the atomic brownian motion which contributes in totally de-correlating
atom positions, whereas in proteins, where the atomic internal motions are confined, the
time-independent part is a non-zero constant.
The time-independent part of (2.38) is usually called Elastic Incoherent Structure Factor (EISF)
and can also be used to redefine the dynamic structure factor in the following manner:
S (q,ω) = EISF(q)δ(ω) + S ′H H(q,ω) (2.39)
44 material and methods
In this form, SH(q,ω) presents an elastic and δ(ω)-shaped component related to the EISF
along with another part, S ′H(q,ω) issued from the quasi-elastic and inelastic spectra of the
s∫ample. Moreover the two parts on the right-hand side of (2.39) are restrained by the relation+
−∞∞ SH(q,ω)dω = F(q, 0) = 1 (with appropriate normalization) which leads to:
∫+∞
dωS ′∞ H(q,ω) + EISF(q)δ(ω) = 1 (2.40)−
By definition, the EISF relates to the ensemble of positions that the scattering nuclei
(hydrogens) can attain during an infinite time and it gives insights into the configurational
space volume the latter can explore.
In practice, the definition of EISF given above suffers from two main biases: from the
experimental point of view δ(ω) cannot be obtained exactly because of the finite resolution
of the instrument used for the measurements and it typically assumes a larger-width shape
(usually fitted as a triangular, gaussian or a lorentzian distribution); from a numerical point
of view, the calculation of the EISF as the limit to infinity of the intermediate scattering
function is very difficult due to the very low statistics attainable for time scales close to the
total time-window used to observe the sample dynamics.
Nevertheless, one can easily overcome these problems by redefining the EISF in both cases: the
measured EISF can be rewritten as the ratio of the elastically scattered intensity integrated over
the frequencies ω to the total integrated intensity (the sum of the elastic and the quasi-elastic
part):
∫+
EISF (q) = −mes ∫∞∞ dω Selasticmes (q,ω)+∞∞ (2.41)−∫ dω Smes(q,ω)
where , +S (q ω) = ∞∞ S (q,ω ′)R(ω − ω ′)dω ′mes − mes takes into account the effects of
the finite experimental resolution represented by the function R(ω) of half-width-at-half-

2.2.2 Spectrometers
The choice of the type of spectrometer to be used to perform the measurements and its
resolution is highly related to the time and length scales of interest. In case one wants to
2.2 neutron scattering 45
investigate the effects of pressure or temperature on the internal dynamics of biological
samples such as proteins, which requires the use of samples in liquid solutions, the
spectrometer resolution should be attentively set to reduce the contribution of the global
diffusion of the sample to the measured signal.
Time-of-flight spectrometers are typically used for measurements of quasielastic scattering
spectra in solids, liquids and molecular crystals.
Time-of-flight spectrometers
In time-of-flight spectrometers, such as the one illustrated in 2.2.2, neutrons from the reactor
strike a sequence of choppers: passing through them the beam is first pulsed and then
selected with respect to its energy E0 and wave vector k0. Therefore the neutrons leave the
last chopper, placed at a known distance dCS from the sample, as a pulsed monochromatic
beam. An array of 3He detectors is arranged at a known fixed distance dSD from the sample,
and scattered neutrons arrive at the detectors at times determined by their scattering energies.
The time-of-flight of a neutron from the last chopper to one of the detectors, the incident

neutron energy and the distances dCS and dSD are directly obtainable from measurements
and allow the calculation of the final energy of scattered neutrons. Moreover, the knowledge
of the angles of scattering allows to solve spectra as a function of momentum and energy
transfer q and h ω.
46 material and methods
The time-of-flight spectrometers typically measure energy transfers in the range 10− 10−2meV ,
hence they are used to investigate dynamics that occur in the time range 10−10 − 10−13s.
All time-of-flight measurements for this work have been performed with the following
spectrometers:
- FOCUS (Paul Scherrer Institut, Zurich, Switzerland ) which is a time-of-flight spectrom-
eter with a variable incident wavelength from 2 to 15 Å. Its energy resolution varies
from 50µeV to 300µeV in the setup with higher incident neutron flux and a maximum
momentum transfert of 8Å−1.
- IN6 (Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble, France) which is a time-of-flight spectrometer
with incident wavelength of 4 to 5.9 Åwith corresponding energy resolution from 50
µeV to 170 µeV . The maximum momentum transfert available is 2.6 Å−1.

EXPER IMENTAL AND S IMULATED SYSTEMS SETUP
3.1 sample production
3.1.1 Protein expression and purification
In the following we will discuss the methods used to produce samples for both neutron and
in silico experiments.
Both approaches demand a wide knowledge of techniques some of which have been already
presented in the previous chapters. The experimental samples also needs some preliminary
steps for their own production which require knowledge in molecular biology. The discussion
of these aspects in detail would be beyond the scope of this thesis, nevertheless, this part of
the work has been fundamental for the following experimental steps as it allowed us to setup
a stable protocol whose yield was adapted to neutron experiments.
The protocol reported here followed the usual scheme for protein production which can be
summarized in a very simplified way, as follow:
- Cloning of the part of the genomic DNA from both Methanococcus Jannaschii and
Saccaromyces cerevisiae which encode the a/eIF6 proteins.
- Massive expression of the identified gene into an host organism, here E.coli, to produce
large amount of proteins.
- Purification of the protein solution obtained from the host organism to obtain an as
much as possible pure solution containing only the a/eIF6 proteins.
cloning Two cloning experiments have been performed to produce the genes encoding
eIF6 and aIF6 proteins. Following the nomenclature found in literature we will call TIF6 the
gene that encodes for eIF6. For M. jannaschii, the genomic DNA fragment encompassing the
aIF6 gene was obtained from TIGR/ATCC Bult et al. [18]. The resulting cDNA was then
amplified by PCR amplification using the nucleotides showed in Table (6).
For S. cerevisiae, TIF6 construct was produced by PCR amplification using genomic DNA
from S. cerevisiae as a template. Cloning experiments were performed using the nucleotides

The forward primers introduced a NdeI restriction site and the reverse primers introduced a
NotI restriction site. The aIF6 and TIF6 PCR products were cloned into a pET28a expression
vector (Novagen). This plasmid contains a kanamycin resistance gene for selection of
transformed cells, and a pBR322 replication origin. The target gene is placed under the control
of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, and is expressed as a fusion with a N-terminal hexahis-
tidine tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagen)
chemically competent cells were transformed with this plasmid in order to express the protein.
The DE3 gene encodes for the T7 RNA polymerase (under the control of the galactose operon).
Transformation was done by heat shock: 1ng of plasmid DNA was mixed with 100µl of
competent cells, and then incubated on ice for 20min. Following adsorption of the plasmid
onto the cell membrane cells are placed at 42◦C for 45 sec, and then on ice for 2 min. 500µl of
SOC medium is added and the cells were incubated 1 h at 37◦C. To select cells which have
been properly transformed, the culture was then plated on LB-agarose plates containing
kanamycin (10 mg/l).
The plates were incubated at 37◦C overnight. The next day 20 ml of LB containing 10 mg/l
kanamycin were inoculated with 1 colony. The cells were grown until the OD600 reached 0.6
AU. 1 ml of the cell suspension was complemented with 100µl of sterilized glycerol, and the
mix was frozen by immersion into liquid nitrogen. The aliquot was stored at -80◦CC.

kanamycin) with cells scraped from the top of the frozen stock. For cultures in Erlenmeyer
flasks, 2.5 l flasks were filled with 1 l of LB media complemented with 10 mg/l kanamycin.
3.1 sample production 49
Each flask was inoculated with 10 ml preculture, then incubated at 37◦C with 200 rpm
agitation until the OD600 reached 0.6-0.8 AU. The temperature was then decreased to
23◦C for 30 min, and 0.5 ml of isopropyl-thiogalactosidase (IPTG) 1 M (0.5 mM final) was
added to induce expression of the cloned protein (via induction of the T7 RNA polymerase).
Incubation was continued in the same conditions for 5 h. The cells were pooled into 1 l
bottles and harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 g. Cell pellets were frozen by flash
cooling in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80◦C.
protein purification For each protein preparation 10 g of frozen cellular paste were
resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer + 40mg of lysozyme (Appendix A). 3 pills of antiprotease
complete EDTA free cocktail and 4 µl of Benzonase enzyme were added. The bacterial
suspension was incubated 20 min on ice with agitation. Then, the cells were lysed twice by
cell disruption (Constant System) at 1.4 Kbar. 1mM β-mercaptoethanol was added to the
solution. Here two different approaches were used for aIF6 and eIF6: i) the crude extract
expressing aIF6 was incubated for 1 hour at 75◦C taking advantage of its heat resistance
properties; ii) the eIF6 was was rapidly brought to the next step to reduce the probability of
proteolytic clevage (see next paragraph). The soluble and insoluble fractions of aIF6 and eIF6
were separated by ultra-centrifugation (1.5 h, 250000 g) for both preparations. The soluble
part of the crude extract was then incubated with 3 ml Talon superflow Cobalt affinity resin
(Clontec) previously equilibrated with lysis buffer; incubation was done at 4◦C for 1.5 h
with gentle agitation. The resin was transfered in a column and washed successively with 10
column volumes of wash solution (Appendix A, 1M NaCl) by gravity. The histidine tagged
IF6 protein was then eluted from the resin using 8 volumes of elution buffer (Appendix A,
250 mM imidazole), and collected in 1.5 ml fractions. Fractions were loaded on a denaturing
gel to check for presence of the overexpressed IF6 protein.
Fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialysed twice for 2 h against imidazole
free, dialysis buffer (Appendix A). The protein concentration was determined by measuring
the OD280 of the solution and thrombin was added (1 u per 150 µg of protein) to
selectively cleave the N-terminal histidine tag of the protein. The cleavage step was done by
incubation overnight (approx. 16 h) at room temperature, and stopped by addition of 0.2
mM (final concentration) phenylmethylsulfonyl-fluoride (PMSF). The completeness of the
proteolysis was checked by SDS-PAGE.The protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a

chromatography. Gel filtration was performed using a Superdex-75 HR 10/30 (Pharmacia)
column previously equilibrated in the protein storage buffer (appendix 1). Both OD280
(optical density at 280nm) and OD260 were monitored during the chromatography to control
the absence of nucleic acids and 500 µl fractions were collected. Peak fractions were pooled
and concentrated a last time using a Centricon (Millipore) ultra-filtration device with a
membrane cutoff of 10 kDa.
poly-histidine tag The use of polyhistidine tags helped to obtain a considerable yield
from the above protocol which allowed a reliable protein concentration to be maintained even
for neutron scattering measurements in high pressure systems where a large solution volume
is necessary. Nevertheless, for technical reasons the selective cleavage of this tag was not
suitable for large volume solutions. For this reason, the cleavage procedure explained above
was performed only on ambient pressure measurements where more convenient volumes
could be used. As a consequence, this protocol must be considered as a first effort toward a
more satisfactory procedure adapted to neutron scattering experiments.
The presence of the histidine tag is not expected to have strong effects on protein structures,
as proved by Carson and coworkers [23] on a wide set of crystallographic structure, but it
could significantly affect the global protein dynamics. For this reason, as shown in Results,
some supplemental tests have been performed to quantify the dynamical contribution of the
tag in the case of a/eIF6.

clevage of carboxyl-terminal tail in eif6 During some preliminary tests for
protocol optimization, a proteolytic clevage of the eIF6 protein was observed (see Figure 13
for the corresponding SDS-PAGE verification), either in the soluble and in insoluble fractions
of the cell lysates.
Figure 13: SDS-PAGE verification of partial clevage in eIF6 samples. Cell lysate shown as reference.
Due to its apparent small molecular weight, the cleaved fragment detected in this work
was supposed to be the same found by Groft and coworkers [66]. The latter reported that
attempts to express and purify S.cerevisiae eIF6 were complicated by proteolytic cleavage of
the divergent C-terminus. They also remarked that truncation beyond residue 224 eliminated
this problem, and eIF6(1-224) could be purified using the same aIF6 purification scheme.
Interestingly, the cleaved part of eIF6 contained a tail made of 21 aminoacids, with sequence
shown in Table 7, which can be found only in eukaryotes homologous of IF6 and very little is
known about its structure.
A preliminary characterization of the fragment was performed by the means of the Basic
Local Alignement Search Tool (BLAST) which compares the aminoacid sequence of the
fragment against sequence databases in order to find some similarities with other known
proteins. For eIF6, the only significant scores were obtained from other IF6 homologous
meaning that this sequence fragment must be strictly peculiar for the function of this class of

initiation factor or of its evolutionary history.
In order to obtain more insights into the native conformation of this C-terminal tail, a test of
secondary structure prediction was performed with two distinct methods:
- PSIPRED server [101], which performs structure predictions based on position-specific
scoring matrices
- APSSP2 server [156], which predicts secondary structure conformations using nearest
neighbor and neural network approaches.
Both methods found a reasonably probable formation of a α-helix in the ending part
of the fragment, in the region Asp238 Thr239 Leu240 Glu241. These results are also
corroborated by the inspection of the hydrophobic profile of the fragment with the help of
the Kyte/Doolittle hydrophilicity scale [122] which shows an increasing hydrophobicity in
the regions Pro229-Ser231 and Asp238-Glu242.
These results lead to the convinction that the fragment could have a significant role either
in dynamics or structure stability of eIF6 and thus also in protein function. This idea is
comforted by recent results which indicate that C-terminal subdomains contribute to the
localization in the cellular nucleus of eIF6 [6].
This outcome suggested the importance of maintaining the 21 C-terminal fragment as part
of the investigated sample. For this purpose, several tests on the production of eIF6 were
performed in order to limit the proteolytic cleavage during the production itself without
effect on the total final yield.
The protocol presented here gave the best results with a cleavage reduced to around 30%
as resulted from the preliminary MALDI mass spectrometry analysis reported in Figure 14
where two large peaks are evident at molecular weights equal to both the entire protein and
the truncated structure (1-224). The height of these peaks gives an estimation of the relative

stability of eif6 When performing studies on the effects of extreme conditions on
protein structure and dynamics it is important to know beforehand the boundaries which
define the normal conditions for the specific protein of interest.
Nevertheless, in the case of IF6 homologues, there is a scarcity of works on the general
chemical properties with respect to temperature and pressure changes. Although aIF6 is
presumably able to reversibly respond to high temperature and high pressure values, very
little can be said about the eIF6. In an early paper on biological properties of eIF6, Valenzuela
and coworkers [199] reported that anti-association factor 6 from calf liver was found to
undergo a cessation of its activity at temperature of ∼ 60◦C. As the inactivation of a protein
function may not correspond to the total and irreversible denaturation of the protein itself,
the latter was tested here by means of dynamic light scattering measurements in the range of
interest of the present work. The measurements of the hydrodynamic radius of eIF6 were
performed with a DynaPro-Titan© fixed-angle light scattering system. The results, listed
in Table 8, shows that, at 50◦C, eIF6 forms aggregates or partially unfolds. Moreover, when
brought back to 30◦C it does not find its initial state, suggesting that the transition is not
reversible.
These preliminary reults together with the outcome of the work made by Valenzuela and
% Intensity

coworkers, suggested to limit all neutron scattering experiments on eIF6 into the non-
denaturating temperature range. However, as explained in the next sections, some in silico
exmperiments have been performed on eIF6 also at high temperature and high pressure
to verify the presence or more simply the beginning of a denaturating process. It is also
worth noting that the reported values of hydrodynamic radius for eIF6 at 20◦C correspond
only to an effective value due to a spherical approximation of the whole protein structure:
the conserved pseudo-globular part formed by residues 1-225 and the C-terminal tail of 21
aminoacids.

final samples For both aIF6 and eIF6, deuterated protein solutions were prepared at a
concentration of ∼ 40mg/ml and pD ∼ 7.0. All labile hydrogen atoms in the samples were
exchanged overnight by dialysis and then filtered with an Amicon Filter Ultra (membrane
cutoff 5kDa) against a thirty-fold excess of pure deuterated solvent. The final solution was
centrifuged to eliminate possible aggregates. The final concentration was measured by
UV-VIS absorption at 280nm. The latter measurement gave results with a possible systematic
error greater than 10% due to the very low amount of chromophore amino acids (such as
tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine) in the sequence of both proteins. Although
the limits for solution concentration of both samples were not known from literature, several
preliminary DLS assays seemed to comfort the observation of monodisperse solutions of eIF6
around 40mg/ml.
3.2 neutron scattering measurements setup
In this work the reported measurements of neutron scattering spectra were performed in
order to investigate the effects of the pressure and temperature changes into the dynamics of
3.2 neutron scattering measurements setup 55
proteins. For quasielastic neutron scattering experiments (QENS), the easiest way to apply
pressure to a biological sample is to put it in a liquid solution and then compress the
volume in which it is contained. This is usually done in sample containers with a cylindrical
geometry. In this work, two different sample containers of this shape have been used for
the measurements at ambient and higher pressure, respectively. The relatively wide range
of temperature values, explored in measurements, imposed for both sample containers, the
choice of materials which do not undergo significant structural changes at high temperature
that could modify, for example, their mechanical resistance.
Moreover, when performing QENS experiments on samples in solution, one often needs
to use high concentrations to maintain the signal due to the sample itself significantly
distinguishable from the one coming from the buffer. For biological macromolecules this fixes
a constraint to the total solution volume used in the experiment as the biological samples
are often available in small quantity mainly due to expression protocols yields. In the case of
a/eIF6, although the protocol presented in the previous section was conceived to obtain a
maximum amount of samples, this was still a limiting factor for the total volume available for
measurements. For this reason the sample containers used in this work were also chosen for
their effective volume.
Ambient pressure An approximate scheme of the sample container used for these
measurements is shown in Figure 15 (panel A). The container is made of two concentric
hollow aluminum cylinders with a diameter of 19mm and 20mm, respectively. The irradiated
region was ∼ 50mm in height. The space between the walls of the two cylinders were
filled by the samples and closed on the top by a disc made of Teflon© in order to avoid
the sample to exit the space due to capillarity effects. The Teflon© cap was supposed
to be out of the irradiated region. The total volume available for samples were limited to 1.2ml.
High pressure The pressure cell was developed at the Institut Laue Langevin in Grenoble
(France) and was conceived to carry out experiments on liquid solutions at moderate high
pressure. In particular the dimensions of the cylindrical geometry were determined to
withstand pressure up to 2kbar: internal diameter of 10mm and wall thickness of 1.5mm. The
global geometry of the cell, shown in Figure in 15 (panel B), was inspired by another one
previously used for high pressure studies on lysozyme and reported in [20].
In contrast to the latter, however, here the pressure is applied without transmitting media
and directly on the sample which is compressed by a pump connected to the pressure cell by
a very thin capillary (0.1mm diameter). Moreover, the irradiated part of the cell was made of
56 experimental and simulated systems setup
Figure 15: Sample can for high pressure measurements
an alloy of copper-berylium which permitted the wall thickness to be significantly reduced
without affect their mechanical resistance. In order to reduce the multiple scattering due to
the protein solution an insert with a diameter of 9 mm was used. As a whole the pressure
system required a total volume of ∼ 3ml of protein solution which is considerably smaller
than the volume commonly used in this type of QENS experiments and suitable for the
typical amount of a/eIF6 production yields.
instrumental resolution The QENS measurements reported in this thesis have
been performed mainly to investigate the internal dynamics of proteins. For this purpose
it was important to filter out of the quesielastic spectra all other contributions coming for
example from the global translation and rotation of proteins in solution. The standard method
to accomplish this task is the choice of an adequate experimental energy resolution which
should be larger than the width HWHM (half-height at half-maximum) of quasielastic signal
due to global motions. The energy width of the latter can be estimated from knowledge of
the translational and rotational diffusion constant of the protein. Unfortunately in the case
3.2 neutron scattering measurements setup 57
of a/eIF6 no reference can be found in litterature and these values could only be estimated
from the available crystallographic structures. Nevertheless, as reported in Results, some a
posteriori finer estimations have been made by means of molecular dynamics simulations.
The values obtained for the conserved structure (residues 1-224) in aIF6 and eIF6 were around
8.4 · 10−3 Å2/ps which correspond, in terms of HWHM, to an energy width of 20 µeV for
a value of q = 1Å−1el . This result should be however corrected by a factor 0.20 due to the
higher viscosity of D2O with respect to that of H2O. The experimental resolution chosen for
measurements at the spectrometers FOCUS (Paul-Sherrer Institut) and IN6 (Institut Laue
Langevin) reported with other experimental settings in Table 9, was not sufficient to totally
eliminate the effects of global motions to the protein spectrum but was enough to significantly
reduce it with respect to the quasielastic signal corresponding to internal diffusive motions.
In this discussion only the translational diffusion constant was taken into account. To estimate
the influence of rotational diffusion on the measured QENS spectra the following formula for
the diffusion constant for rotational diffusion [36] was used:
kBT
γr = . (3.1)
4πηR3H
The above relation is used assuming that the approximation of eIF6 as a spherical-shaped
protein is reliable1. Here RH is the radius of the protein and η is the shear viscosity of
the solvent (water). For a/eIF6, which has a radius of RH = 2.81nm, one obtains γr =
0.14 · 108 s−1 at T = 293K. This corresponds to a width of 6 · 10−5meV , which is far below the
instrumental resolution. Therefore, spectral contribution from the global rotational diffusion
are expected to be largely within the chosen energy resolutions.

Stoke’s law for the diffusion of a sphere.This refinement will not change however the considerations made here.

3.2.1 Data analysis
The usual procedure for the analysis of data from neutron scattering measurements, is
preceded by some preliminary as follows:
- Normalization to the total number of incident neutrons during a single measurement.
This normalization is needed to account for the differences in time length and in incident
neutron flux for each measurement
- Correction for the detector efficiencies. It is performed in two steps. Firstly by the
normalization to the spectrum of vanadium performed with the same experimental
environment which corrects for relative efficiencies of detectors with respect to each
other. Secondly a correction is made with respect to the energy dependent efficiency of
detectors. A vanadium spectrum is used for the first calibration because it is a completely
elastic incoherent scatterer in the range of q of interest in time-of-flight experiments.
- Grouping of spectra over angles is made to increase the statistics related to data.
The latter procedure was crucial because the signal-to-noise ratio in measurements of
biological samples in solution is usually very low.
In QENS measurements on protein solutions, the detected signal does not come exclusively
from the protein but shows also significant contribution from the bulk solvent and from
the sample environment, like for example, the sample containers and background noise.
The spurious contributions are usually subtracted from the total signal to obtain scattering
functions related only to the protein dynamics. This procedure can be summarized by the
following relation:
S˜protein(q,ω) = (SS(q,ω) − τ ∗ SE(q,ω)) − (1−α) ∗ (SB(q,ω) − τ ∗ SE(q,ω)) (3.2)
where τ takes into account the transmission of the protein solution2 and α is the volume
fraction of the protein and its first hydration shell in the solution sample.The latter must be
known to apply a correct subtraction of solvent contribution in protein solution spectra.
The parameter α was estimated from the following relation between the mass density of
proteins and their mo[lecular weight (M((KDa)) [54]: )]
M(KDa)
ρ(M)[g/cm3] = 1.41+ 0.145 · exp − (3.3)
13
2 Through out this thesis the transmission of the protein solution was approximated to the one of the buffer alone
3.3 molecular dynamics setups 59
For a/eIF6 one obtains ρ = 1.43g/cm3, which gives a specific volume ν = 0.70cm3prot /g.
Multiplying by the estimated concentration of 40mg/ml one has the volume fraction α =
0.028. The hydration shell needs to be included as part of the protein because the dynamics
of water molecules in this shell is different from the one of bulk water due to the weak
interactions occurring between the protein and solvent molecules.
Gerstein and Chothia [63] showed that hydration water volume is equal to 24 Å3 which
means it is 20% smaller than the volume of bulk water. Hence, the increase of protein specific
volume due to its first hydration shell can be estimated as follows:
ν = νprot + νshellN
where N is the number of protein molecules in the unit volume and
νshell = rshell ·Awater
In the above equation rshell represents the radius of the spheres with the same volume of
water molecules in the first hydration shell and Awater is the surface area of the protein
accessible to solvent molecules with radius rshell. For lack of more precise estimations, in the
case of IF6, the value of νshell was approximated with the Surface Accessible Surface Area
(SASA) calculated on the crystallographic structure of aIF6. The obtained value corresponds
to a hydration layer composed by approximately 850 water molecules per protein molecule.
Hence, the final volume fraction α was found equal to 0.04.
As stated at the end of the previous section, the measurement of the protein concentration
in the final samples was made very difficult by the poor UV-VIS absorption of a/eIF6. As
a consequence, all values obtained from the considerations made above, which are strictly
dependent to the knowledge of the real protein concentration, have to be considered here as
strong approximations and they will be used only as references in the Results.
3.3 molecular dynamics setups
We performed all the stages of the molecular dynamics simulations using the AMBER9
simulation code[27]. The whole set of final simulations for both the homologues used the
AMBER99SB force field [86]. The latter is an upgraded version of the AMBER94 force field,
usually used for protein molecular dynamics, and it contains a reparametrization of the back-
60 experimental and simulated systems setup
bone torsion terms and achieves a better balance of the different secondary structure elements.
3.3.1 System Setup
aIF6
The initial configuration of the IF6 protein issued from the M.Jannaschii was taken from a
crystal structure with a refined resolution of 1.30 Å(available from the Protein DataBank with
the code: 1G61)[66] together with all the water molecules found within a distance of 2nm
from the protein center of mass in the crystallographic data. The coordinates of the missing
hydrogen atoms were added using the algorithms implemented in the LEaP program from
the AMBER9 package.
The protein was placed in a orthorhombic periodic box filled with water molecules
parametrized as TIP3P. The crystallographic water represented by oxygen atoms, within a
distance of 2nm from the protein center of mass, were replaced by the same type of water
molecule models. The final total amount of water molecules was 8136. The whole system
includes also 14 sodium (Na+) counterions in order to obtain a neutral global charge for the
Ewald calculations.
The whole system was initially minimized in two steps with combined use of steepest-
descent and conjugated-gradient algorithms: i) 200 cycles of conjugated-gradient after 4 steps
of steepest-descent with position restraint on protein atoms and counter ions; ii) 200 cycles
of conjugated-gradient after 4 steps of steepest-descent for the whole system without restraint.
As a preliminary step of the real molecular dynamics simulation, we first performed
a system equilibration step in which the simulated system attained a stable equilibrium
conformation compatible with the environmental constraints, i.e. constant pressure and
temperature. For this purpose, a short simulation of 150ps in a NVT ensemble, i.e. with
fixed total volume and temperature kept equal to 300K was performed, followed by a 700ps
long simulation in the final NPT ensemble, with T = 300K and P = 1bar. In all simulations
performed in this work the time-step used for the integration of motion equation was equal
to ∆t = 0.001ps = 1fs (fs is femto-seconds). The equilibration in the NVT ensemble was
made with the calculation of the contribution of the forces slowly-varying in space only every
3.3 molecular dynamics setups 61
two steps, resulting in a shorter CPU-time without significant changes in the total energy of
the system.
From the equilibration at 300K and 1bar all other simulations branched to other NPT
conditions of interest. In every case the equilibration steps were followed by production
simulations of length equal to 2ns which was used for the calculation of dynamical properties
of the system itself.
In each simulation the control of temperature was performed with a Langevin thermostat3
with a collision rate of 3.5ps−1, whereas pressure was constrained by a Berendsen barostat
relaxation time τp = 1.5ps.
3.3.2 eIF6
The initial configuration of the IF6 protein issued from the S.cerevisiae was taken from a
crystal structure with a refined resolution of 2.5 Å(available from the Protein DataBank with
the code: 1G62)[66]. Nevertheless, the crystallographic data contained in the original PDB
file did not give the atom positions of the 21 amino acids long C-terminal tail which was
not crystallized with the rest of the proteolytic cleavage protein because of the structural
instability that was encountered in this work during the sample production, as mentioned in
Section 3.1.1. The presence of this tail, even though it does not seem to influence the function
of eIF6 [66], certainly has some effects on protein mobility [6].
The construction of the complete structure of eIF6 required some supplementary steps with
respect to the case of aIF6. Firstly the structure of the C-terminal tail (CTAIL, in the following)
was modeled and partially folded. Secondly the complete structure was assembled and
equilibrated to an appropriate equilibrium state.
Both steps of this preliminary procedure were performed by means of molecular dynamics
simulations with implicit solvent in order to significantly reduce the CPU-time [198]. This
method consist of the substitution of the explicit calculation of the dynamics of solvent
molecules -usually very time-consuming - with an additional mean forces term in the protein
force-field which should take account of all solvent effects on the protein. This approach
3 The chosen collision rate for Langevin thermostat did not produce artifacts on IF6 dynamics as verified
by comparison of effective friction constant calculated from NPT ensemble with the one obtained from a
NVE (constant energy) simulation of the same system. Friction constant was estimated by memory function
calculation[118].
62 experimental and simulated systems setup
clearly contains some strong approximations and it does not always give the right description
of dynamics if compared with explicit solvent calculations [146] but it is however a valuable
tool to rapidly explore the configuration space of large systems in order to find an appropriate
equilibrium state. The implicit solvent model used throughout this thesis was the pairwise
Generalized Born solvation model (GB), developed by Hawkins and coworkers [70, 71],
where mean forces are obtained from the estimation of the total solvation free energy of the
molecule into water. A complete description of the method can be found in many textbooks
on methods in computational physics and biology [12].
ctail folding Here a brief summary of the protocol used for the modeling and the
initial folding of CTAIL is reported. The whole procedure was performed using the LEaP and
Sander programs from the AMBER9 package.
. A "linear" configuration was firstly created for the polypeptide with sequence shown in
Table 7.
. Initial folding of the linear structure was then performed in a NVT ensemble with the pro-
tocol for the temperature re-scaling shown in Table 10. The time step for the integration
of equation of motion was varied between 0.1 and 0.5 fs, in order to reduce the extent
of force variation and thus the probability of unnatural atom contacts which would
prevent the CTAIL from folding correctly.

. The final step of this procedure was a very long equilibration simulation in which the
protein fragment could fold. The total time length of this simulation was ∼ 40ns. A
shorter simulation with explicit solvent was also performed to verify the absence of
solvent-specific effects in CTAIL folding.
Interestingly, the final folded structure of CTAIL, shown in Figure 16 (Panel A), contains a
small helix in the region 14-18 whose shape is similar to an α-type. The inclusion of this helix
into the protein sequence corresponds to the one found in Section 3.1.1 by means of structure
prediction and hydrophobic arguments.
Figure 16: Modeling of CTAIL in implicit solvent. Panel A shows structure folded without contraints.
Panel B: structure folded with a position restraint in amino-terminus. Color scheme: purple
for α-helix, blue for 310-helix, cyan for turns and white for random coil.
It is worth noting that the folded configuration obtained here might not correspond to the
one that CTAIL would reach when folded together with the rest of the protein sequence. For
this reason, the same procedure was repeated with the amino-terminal position fixed in space
by an harmonic force, F = −Kx, with K = 10 kcal mol−1 Å2 . The resulting final structure
was compared with the previous one in order to better understand the effects of the spatial
constraints in the folding pathways. The resulting structure after a total simulation time of
40ns is shown in Figure (Panel B). Inspection by eye reveals that secondary and tertiary
structures are slightly different. This comparison indicate that CTAIL folding is very sensitive
64 experimental and simulated systems setup
to the number of degrees of freedom available for its three-dimensional configurations.
modeling of eif6’s complete structure The above paragraph showed the
importance of an ultimate verification of the actual conformations of CTAIL when the latter is
joined to the rest of the protein. A complete study on this subject would be out of the scope
of this thesis and would need a more exhaustive simulation of folding of the whole protein.
Here I would like to focus on more qualitative considerations about the effects induced on
the rest of the eIF6 structure by the presence of CTAIL. For this purpose, in the following it
will be supposed that the conserved region of aIF6 and eIF6 (residues 1-224) does not attain a
different fold in the presence of CTAIL. This assumption seems to be confirmed as reliable by
homology modeling study of different homologues of IF6 from a wide range of different
organisms [66].
On these bases, another molecular dynamics simulation with implicit solvent was
performed on the system composed by CTAIL directly joined to the rest of "already-folded"
eIF6 structure. The initial configuration used for this simulation was composed by CTAIL
folded through the procedure described above and the crystallographic structure of eIF6.
The binding of the two subunits of the system was performed by the creation of the peptide
bond between the nitrogen atom in the C-terminus of the residue 224 and the nitrogen atom
in the N-terminus of CTAIL. The latter structure was then minimized with restraints in
atom positions in residues from 1 to 200 and with fixed hydrogen covalent bond-length (the
SHAKE algorithm[35] for rigid molecule dynamics was used here). The procedure consisted
of 900 steps of minimization using the steepest-descent gradient method followed by 1100
steps performed with the conjugated-gradient algorithm.
The energy minimization was followed by a short equilibration run of molecular dynamics
(30ps) in a NVT ensemble, i.e. with constant volume and temperature. The Langevin
thermostat was used to keep temperature constant. Here, in order to significantly improve the
thermal coupling between the system and the thermostat a very high friction constant value
(γ = 500 ps−1). A short time step (∆t = 0.5 fs) for the Leapfrog integrator was used in order to
avoid improper fluctuations of potential energy which would result in total energy divergence.
Local optimization of the protein conformation found through the previous steps, was
performed using the simulated annealing method which consists, as for the real annealing of

matter, in a sequence of heating and cooling phases. The latter, which is commonly used
for finding of the global minimum of potential surfaces in the case of small molecules, was
shown to not be reliable for systems with a broad distribution of energy scales. Nevertheless,
several works demonstrated that it remains very useful method for local optimization of
larger molecules conformations, such as proteins, because unlike minimization methods, it is
able to locate local minima even far away from the initial conformation[208]. The sequence of
annealing steps used in this work is shown in Table 11 and was performed with the same
parameters settings as the previous equilibration step.

CHARACTER IZAT ION OF PROTE IN STRUCTURE
In the next chapters a new method for the characterization of protein secondary structure
will be presented. The development of this method, called ScrewFit, was inspired by the task
of finely characterize the environmental effects on protein structures.
ScrewFit was then found to be able to make precise assessments on protein secondary
structure motifs and also to find local and global structural effects induced by ligand binding.
The text proposed here has been already published or is under review as scientific articles
in international peer-reviewed journals. The original text is reprinted here together with
supplemental data and notes at the end of each article.

EFF IC IENT CHARACTER ISAT ION OF PROTE IN SECONDARY
STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF SCREW MOTIONS
We present a simple and efficient method to describe the secondary structure of proteins in
terms of orientational distances between consecutive peptide planes and local helix parame-
ters. The method uses quaternion-based superposition fits of the protein peptide planes in
conjunction with Chasles’ theorem, which states that any rigid body displacement can be
described by a screw motion. From the best superposition of consecutive peptide planes we
derive the helix parameters, and the “worst” fit is used to define the orientational distance.
Applications are shown for standard secondary structure motifs of peptide chains, for some
proteins belonging to different fold classes, and for a description of structural changes in
lysozyme under hydrostatic pressure. In the latter case we use published reference data which
have been obtained by X-ray crystallography and by structural NMR measurements.

72 efficient characterisation of protein secondary structure in terms of screw motions
5.1 introduction
The determination and characterisation of protein secondary structure is a fundamental
task in molecular biology, crystallography and in simulation studies. In many situations
arises the necessity to quantify in particular structural changes of a protein, which are due
to a change of its environment. The influence of temperature or pressure on the fold of a
protein is a typical example. Standard motifs in protein secondary structure are traditionally
described in terms of two torsional angles, φ and ψ, per residue, which define for each
Cα-atom the rotation of the left and right peptide plane about the N−Cα and Cα −C
bond, respectively [187]. In the past different methods have been developed to determine
secondary structure elements [106, 163, 57, 190] and to describe their geometry in more
detail [9, 181, 194]. A rigourous mathematical description of protein secondary structure
can be obtained by applying the theory of screw motions, where the winding of the protein
backbone is described in terms of local helix parameters. The theory of screw motions goes
back to the mathematician M. Chasles [32, 33], and a useful recent introduction can be found
in the book by Selig [176]. In a recent paper, Quine [155] uses screw motion theory and
constructs local helix parameters for a protein from the torsion angles φ and ψ. An important
step is the introduction of quaternions which can be related to the (φ,ψ)-angles on one hand,
and to the rotation/helix axis on the other hand.
In this article we present an efficient method for the characterisation of protein secondary
structure, which is based on quaternion superposition fits of consecutive peptide planes.
From the resulting quaternion parameters we construct the local helix geometry of the protein
backbone, and we show that the superposition method may also be used to define a scalar
measure for the orientational distance between consecutive peptide planes. The latter allows
to distinguish between all common secondary structure motifs, such as different helix types
and β-strands, except for handedness.
In the following section the method is briefly explained and applications are presented in
Section 5.3. The first one concerns an illustration for simple model structures, such as right-
and left-handed α-helices and β-strands. We show then how our method works for proteins
which fall into different fold classes, and discuss finally in more detail how it can be used
to quantify changes in the secondary structure of lysozyme which are caused by external
pressure. For this purpose we use published reference structures which have been obtained
from X-ray crystallography and from structural NMR measurements. The essential results are
summarised and discussed in Section 5.4. In the Appendix we recall the essential properties
5.2 method 73
of quaternions and give a short constructive proof of Chasles’ theorem, which demonstrates
the usefulness of quaternion calculus.
5.2 method
As stated in the introduction, our method for the description of protein secondary structure
relies on quaternion-based superposition fits of molecular structures. The method is well
established, and we refer to articles by Kearsley [111] and by Kneller [115] for details. Here
we use that the quaternion method does not only yield the “best” fit, from which local helix
parameters describing the winding of the protein backbone can be constructed, but also the
“worst” fit, from which an orientational distance measure can be derived.
5.2.1 Quaternion superposition fits
Suppose that {r } and {r ′~α ~α} are two sets of vectors describing the positions of atoms repre-
senting equivalent molecular structures A and B, respectively. Both structures contain the
same number of atoms and are somehow placed in space. A rigid-body displacement A→ B
can be defined as an optimisation problem, where structure A is fitted onto structure B in a
least squares sense. In case that both structures are identical, the resulting fit error will be
zero. One starts by constructing the translation vector ~t = ~R ′ − ~c Rc connecting the two centres
of rotation, C and C ′, which are to be chosen in the same way for A and B, and computes
the coordinate sets {x } and {x ′α α} containing the relative atomic positions to the respective
rotation centres. Here and in the following the prime refers to the target structure B. The
optimal rotation is obtained by minimising the target function
∑N
m(q) = w (D · x − x ′ 2α α α) (5.1)
α=1
with respect to a set of angular variables which parametr∑ise the orthogonal rotation matrix
D. Each atom is assigned a positive weight wα, with αwα = 1. A convenient set of
angular variables are normalised (real) quaternion parameters, q ≡ {q0,q1,q2,q3}, with
q2 + q2 + q2 + q20 1 2 3 = 1. In this case D takes the form [4]
 
 q20 + q21 − q22 − q2 3
2(−q0q3 + q1q2) 2(q0q2 + q1q3) 

74 efficient characterisation of protein secondary structure in terms of screw motions
and describes a proper rotation with det(D) = +1. Using the orthogonality of D, the target
function m(q) can be written as a quadratic form in the quaternion parameters,
m(q) = qT ·M · q, (5.3)
where q = (q ,q ,q ,q )T0 1 2 3 is a column vector and M is a positive semi-definite matrix. The
superscript “T” denotes a transposition. The matrix M has the form [111, 115]
∑  N (x − x ′ 2 T α α) uαM = w α  , (5.4)
α=1 uα Pα
where uα and Pα are given by
u = 2x ∧ x ′α α α, (5.5)
P = x · x ′T + x ′ · xTα α α α α. (5.6)
The minimization of m(q) with respect to the quaternion parameters must be performed
with the side constraint qT · q = 1. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers one is lead
to the eigenvector problem
M · q = λq. (5.7)
Sincem(q) > 0 the matrixM is positive semi-definite, and one obtains a set of four real eigen-
values, {λj}, with λj > 0 (j = 1, . . . , 4), and a set of corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors,
{q }, with qTj j · qk = δjk. Here δjk is the Kronecker symbol. It follows from (5.3) and (5.7) that
m(qj) = λj. (5.8)
The eigenvalues are thus the residuals of the fit and can be ordered such that
λ1 6 λ2 < λ3 6 λ4. (5.9)
The quaternion corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue, λ1, is thus the solution for the
optimal fit, and the quaternion parameters q describe the relative orientation of {x ′1 α} with
respect to {xα}.
We note that one obtains two twofold degenerate eigenvalues if the structures to be
superposed are linear. In this case one has [115]
∑ ( )
λ = w |x |2 + |x ′ |2 ∓ 2|x ||x ′a,b α α α α α| , (5.10)
α
5.2 method 75
where a = 1, 2, b = 3, 4, and both the rotation leading to the minimum and maximum distance
are not uniquely determined. Any normalized linear combination of the two eigenvectors
associated with λa and λb, respectively, describes an equivalent rotation.
The use of quaternion parameters in not only very convenient for finding a rigid-body
transformation between two sets of coordinates, but the result can also be directly related to
conventional representations ofrotations. Here the following relation is of importance:
q ≡ q0  cos(φ/2)=  . (5.11)
qv sin(φ/2)n
From the scalar part of a quaternion, q0, one obtains thus directly the rotation angle and
the rotation axis can be extracted from the vectorial part, qv. It should be noted that the
transformation φ → φ+ 2π, which leaves the rotation matrix D(n,φ) invariant, leads to a
global change in sign of the quaternion parameteres. One verifies easily that q(n,φ+2π) = −q.
The pair of quaternions {Q,−Q} is thus mapped onto the same rotation matrix D(q).
5.2.2 Orientational distance
The eigenvalue describing the “worst” superposition – λ4 according to the ordering scheme
(5.9) – can b√e used to define an orientational distance between two molecular structures via
M11
∆Ω = . (5.12)
λ4
Eq. (5.4) shows that the matrix elementM11 contains the squared Euclidean distance between
the vectors sets {x } and {x ′~α ~α}, and therefore ∆Ω is the Euclidean distance normalised to its
maximum possible value. Consequently,
0 6 ∆Ω 6 1. (5.13)
It is important to note that definition (6.5) yields a unique orientational distance of two
linear molecular structures, whose relative orientation has no unique description in terms
of angular variables. Supposing that |x ′α| = |xα| for α = 1, . . . ,N, we see from eq. (5.10) that
for linear rigid bodies ∆Ω = 0 in the parallel configuration and ∆Ω = 1 in the anti-parallel
configuration. We note here that λb, as given by eq. (5.10), is a strict upper limit for the
Euclidean distance of two molecular structures in general [116].

5.2.3 Chasles’ theorem
T −→Let r = (x,y, z) be a column vector containing the coordinates of a radius vector ~r = OP
of a point P in a rigid body, where O is the origin of the coordinate system. An arbitrary
rigid-body displacement is described by a rotation about a point C, which is not necessarily
located inside the rigid body, and a subsequent translation. Let Rc be the coordinates of
−→ −−→
the radius vector ~R = OC and let t be the coordinates of the translation vector ~t = CC ′c ,
where C ′ is the centre of rotation after the translation. The coordinates of P after a rigid body
displacement are then given by
r ′ = Rc +D · (r−Rc) + t, (5.14)
where D is an orthogonal 3× 3 matrix. In the following only proper rotations with det(D) =
+1 will be considered. If n = (n ,n ,n )Tx y z contains the components of the unit vector n~ ,
pointing in the direction of the rotation axis, and φ is the angle of rotation, the corresponding
rotation matrix can be written as
D(n,φ) = P‖ + cos(φ)P⊥ + sin(φ)N, (5.15)
where P = n ·nT‖ and P⊥ = 1 −P‖ are, respectively, the projectors onto n~ and its complement,
and N is the antisymmetric matrix

The theorem of Chasles states that one can find a reference point X, whose radius vector
−→
~Rx = OX has the coordinates Rx, such that
r ′ = Rx +D(n,φ) · (r−Rx) +αn. (5.17)
This coordinate transformation describes a screw motion, with translation α parallel to
the axis of rotation. For the following considerations we introduce the difference vector
~u = ~R − ~x Rc. Equating relations (5.14) and (5.17) and using that n is an eigenvector of D, one
finds that the coordinates of ~u satisfy the following set of linear equations
(1 −D) · u = t⊥. (5.18)
Here t⊥ = P⊥ · t. As shown in Section 5.5, the above equation has a linear manifold of
solutions,
u(λ) = u⊥ + λn, λ ∈ R, (5.19)
5.3 applications 77
where u⊥ is perpendicular to n and has the explicit form
1( )
u⊥ = t⊥ + cot(φ/2)n∧ t . (5.20)
2
In absolute coordinates the axis of the screw motion is given by
Rx = Rc + u⊥ + λn, (5.21)
and
R⊥x = Rc + u⊥ (5.22)
contains the coordinates of the radius vector ~R⊥ relating the origin with the point X⊥x on the
helix axis which is closest to the reference point C. In the following X⊥ will be referred to
as centre of screw motion. The radius ρ of the corresponding screw motion is given by the
Euclidean length of u , since the latter is the vector pointing from ~R to X⊥~⊥ c . Using (5.20) one
finds
√
|t⊥|
ρ = 1+ cot2(φ/2). (5.23)
2
It should be noted that ρ diverges if φ is a multiple of 2π, corresponding to pure translations,
and if |t⊥| 6= 0.
5.3 applications
5.3.1 Screw motion description of protein main chains
The method described above, which will be referred to as ScrewFit in the following, is now
applied to define the local helical structure of polypeptides and proteins. The rigid bodies are
here the triangles formed by the atoms {O,C,N} in the backbone of polypeptides – see Fig. 19
– which define the so-called peptide planes. Here the C-atoms are the centres of rotation, and
the translation vectors are thus the position differences between the C-atoms in consecutive
amino acids, ti = RC(i+1) −RC(i). The quaternion parameters qi are obtained from the fit of
the {O,C,N}-triangle of peptide bond i onto the one of peptide bond i+ 1. From each set of
quaternion parameters the direction n~ of the rotation axis and the rotation angle φ can be
computed from relation (6.4).
The following parameters are used to define the local helix structure of a polypeptide:
• The helix radius ρ defined in eq. (6.6).

• The number of amino acids per turn,
2π
τ = . (5.24)
φ
• The pitch, which is defined as
p = |R⊥ −R⊥x,i+1 x,i|τ. (5.25)
Here ~R⊥ is the radius vector pointing from the origin to the centre X⊥x,i i of the screw
motion relating peptide plane i and peptide plane i+ 1.
• The handedness, which is defined as the sign of the projection of the translation vector
~ti onto the direction n~ i of the local helix axis,
h = sign(nTi · ti). (5.26)
• The straightness parameter σ of the local helix axis. For residue i the latter is defined as
σ = µTi i · µi+1, (5.27)
where

µi = . (5.28)
|R⊥ ⊥x,i+1 −Rx,i|
• The orientational distance between the peptide planes {O,C,N} in residues i and i+ 1,
which is defined through relation (6.5).
5.3.2 Model structures
We apply ScrewFit first to well-known model structures for polypeptides which have been
taken from the Image Library of Biological Macromolecules in Jena 1. Table 13 shows the
corresponding local helix parameters which have been defined in the previous section. All
model peptides are polyalanine molecules containing 10 residues, except for the extended
conformation, which is represented by the alanine-tripeptide shown in Fig. 19. In all cases
the N-terminus is the starting point of the respective polypeptide chain. In the context of our
study all motifs are considered as helices, a β-strand being simply a thin left-handed helix
with 2 amino acids per turn2.

The parameters concerning the different secondary structure motifs shown in Table 13 may
be compared to those published in the study of Barlow and Thornton [9]. Here one must pay
attention to the fact that the helix radius depends on the reference point which is chosen to
lie on the helix surface. In our case this is the carbon atom in the {O−C−N} peptide plane.
If the carbon Cα-atom is chosen instead, we find the values given in the column with the
header “ρ ”.

The parameters we find for the right-handed α-helix are very close to the ones given
by Barlow and Thornton, who compare different standard definitions with average values
computed from a set of 291 helices in “real” proteins. The parameters listed in the above
reference are in the intervals 0.23 6 ρ 6 0.24, 3.54 6 τ 6 3.67, and 0.52 6 p 6 0.55,
respectively, using our notation and units (ρ and p in nm). In case of the 3-10 helix the
spread of the parameters given by Barlow and Thornton is 0.18 6 ρ 6 0.20, 3.0 6 τ 6 3.2,
and 0.58 6 p 6 0.60. Parameters for π-helices are not listed. It should be noted that the
orientational distance takes well distinguishable values for the different secondary structure
motifs, but left and right-handed motifs cannot be distinguished by this parameter.
5.3.3 Proteins in different fold classes
In the following we will show the results of ScrewFit for proteins which fall into the four
main fold classes according to the SCOP scheme [145]:
1. Carbonmonoxy-myoglobin (PDB code 1A6G), which belongs to the “all alpha” class.
2. Protease inhibitor ecotin (PDB code 1ECY), which belongs to the “all beta” class.
3. Triose phosphate isomerase from chicken muscle (PDB code 1TIM), which belongs to
the “alpha/beta” class. Proteins falling into this class consist mainly of parallel β-sheets,
which are separated by α-helices.
4. Hen egg white lysozyme (PDB code 193L), which falls into the “alpha + beta” class. Pro-
teins of this type contain mainly anti-parallel β-sheets and separated regions containing
α-helices.
The latter application is postponed to the next section, where we consider structural changes
of lysozyme under pressure. In this context the ScrewFit parameters will also be discussed in
more detail. Here we give only an impression of the results, as compared to DSSP.
Figs. 20 to 22 shows the comparison first three proteins in the list given above. In each figure
we give the local orientational distance, ∆Ω, the local helix radius, ρ, and the straightness

the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB). The vertical stripes correspond to the secondary
structure motifs found by the DSSP method by Kabsch and Sander, which is based on
hydrogen bonding criteria and which is widely used for the determination of secondary
structure elements in proteins [106]. The colouring scheme indicates α-helices in light green
and β-strands in light blue.
One recognises that the ScrewFit method often leaves some ambiguity concerning the
boundaries of secondary structure elements. This is simply due to the fact that it is sensitive
to deviations from ideal geometries. This effect is in particular visible in the behaviour of
straightness parameter. Similar observations have been made by comparing the method by
Barlow and Thornton with DSSP [9].
5.3.4 Lysozyme under hydrostatic pressure
In the following we apply our method to visualise structural changes in lysozyme due to the
application of an external pressure. For this purpose we consider protein structures which
have been obtained from X-ray crystallography and from NMR measurements. The X-ray
structures are taken from the entries 193L and 3LYM of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank
(PDB), which contain the atomic coordinates of hen egg-white lysozyme at pressures of,
5.3 applications 83
respectively, 1 bar and 1 kbar [202, 121]. The NMR structures are taken from PDB entries
1GXV and 1GXX, corresponding to 1 bar and 2 kbars, respectively [159]. Fig. 23 shows
the backbone of lysozyme at 1 bar (blue tube) obtained from the crystal structure together
with the line joining the centres of screw motion mapping each peptide plane onto the
consecutive one (red line). The centres of the screw motions have been constructed according
to expression (5.22). Inspection by eye shows that that the red line passes right through the
geometrical centres of the helices.
More details can be obtained from Figs. 24 and 25 which show the same parameters as
in Figs. 20 to 22. In both cases the curves corresponding to the structures under pressure
are given in red. The green and blue horizontal lines correspond again, respectively, to the
reference values for an α-helix and a β-strand given in Table 13. Here the vertical stripes
indicate the secondary structures according to the PDBsum data base. The latter uses the
PROMOTIF program for secondary structure determination [89], which is itself based on the
DSSP method. In addition to α-helices we indicate also 3-10 helices in dark green.
For the crystal structure entries 193L and 3LYM the PDBsum database displays three long
helices in the residue intervals {5− 14}, {25− 36}, and {89− 99}, and four short ones in the
residue intervals {80− 84}, {104− 107}, {109− 114}, and {120− 123}. In addition three short
β-strands of 2–3 residues are displayed in the regions {43 − 45}, {51 − 53}, and {58 − 59},
respectively. We note here that only the long helices are described in the work by Barlow and
Thornton [9]. Concerning the NMR structures, the PDBsum database lists again the three
long helices ({5− 14}, {25− 36}, {89− 98}), but only two short ones ({80− 84}, {109− 114}). In
contrast, the short β-strands are displayed at almost the same positions as for the crystal
structures ({44− 46}, {50− 53}, {58− 59}). As for the crystal structures, the structural motifs
are found for both pressures at identical positions.
Looking first at Fig. 24 displaying the parameters corresponding to the crystal structures
shows that the orientational distance is a good measure to localise rapidly secondary structure
elements in the amino acid sequence of a protein. For the moment we discuss only the
structure at ambient pressure. The analysis of the helix radius and the straightness gives
more detailed information. The three long helices and also the three short β-strands are
easily localised. We find that the first helix ({5− 14}) is straight only in the region {5− 11}.
Towards the C-terminus the straightness drops considerably and the orientational distance
rises. The helix radius stays approximately constant up to about residue number 15. We
find that the second helix ({25− 36}) is deformed as well towards its C-terminus, but here
the orientational distances stays more or less constant, whereas the helix radius and the

motions, X⊥, mapping each peptide plane onto the following one.
straightness change considerably. We consider this helix to be straight in the range {25− 32}.
Similar observations can be made for the third long helix, which we find to be straight in the
range {89− 96}. We note here that Barlow and Thornton consider the first of the above helices
as “irregular” and the others as “curved”, using, however, different criteria. Concerning the
shorter helices, which are not considered helices by Barlow and Thornton, we confirm less
well defined helices in the ranges {80− 84}, {104− 107}, {119− 123}, and {109− 114}. According
to the orientational distance, the first three of them are 3-10 helices. As for the β-strands, our
analysis would confirm the short one in the range {58− 59}, but yield longer strands in the
regions {42− 46} and {50− 53}. It is worthwhile mentioning that the straightness parameter
indicates hairpin turns between the β-strands, leading to antiparallel β-sheets.
Applying ScrewFit to the NMR structure of lysozyme at ambient pressure yields the
following results: the three long helices indicated by PDBsum are retrieved, and, using the
orientational distance as criterion, we confirm less well defined helices in the ranges {80− 84}
(3-10 helix) and {109− 114} (α-helix). According to our analysis the first β-strand is longer
than the one displayed in the PDBsum database (approximately in {41− 45}).
Let us now look at the changes in secondary structure of lysozyme due to the exertion
of an external pressure. We start with the analysis of the crystallographic data by Kundrot
and Richards [121]. The black line in Fig. 26 shows that the structural change obtained from
the crystal structures is localised at residue no. 72. All parameters show a change in the

values given in Table 13 and the vertical stripes indicate here the secondary structures
according to the PDBsum database. More explanations are given in the text

tube representation, using a colouring scheme where red corresponds to a negative change,
green to no change, and blue to a positive change. In their study Kundrot and Richards
perform a difference distance matrix analysis of the structural changes and report that the
least changes are seen in helix 2 ({25− 36}) and in the loop and β-sheet region {42− 60},
whereas a stronger structural change is seen in region {61− 87}, which appears to expand.
We note here that Kundrot and Richards call this region “loop region”, not counting the short
3-10 helix {80− 84}. This observation is coherent with ours, which shows in particular a strong
rise of the local helix radius at residue 72, corresponding to a swelling of the corresponding
loop region.

NMR = magenta line).
The corresponding analysis for the NMR structures is less clear (see Fig. 25, magenta
lines). Here the orientational distance and the helix radius do not exhibit significant changes,
whereas the straightness shows a strong decrease at residue no. 60. which is located at the
very beginning of the long loop in residue range {60 − 80}. Refaee et al. report the most
extensive deformations in the loop and what they call “β-sheet domain” ({40− 88}), which is
certainly in agreement with a very localised change in secondary structure at residue no. 60.
We do, however, not see considerable changes in the hairpin turns {47− 49} and {54− 57} seen
by Refaee et al.. Fig. 28 shows the change in straightness for the NMR structure of lysozyme
in a tube plot in which the same colouring scheme is used as in Fig. 27.

5.4 conclusion
We have presented a simple method – ScrewFit – for the characterisation of protein secondary
structure which uses quaternion-based superposition fits of consecutive peptide planes in
88 efficient characterisation of protein secondary structure in terms of screw motions
the backbone. The combined use of the quaternion fit method and Chasles’ theorem allows
to express protein secondary structure in terms of local helix parameters. The superposition
method yields also an orientational distance measure for consecutive peptide planes. The
latter is obtained from the “worst” possible quaternion fit and yields a simple measure for the
rapid localisation of secondary structure elements along the protein backbone. The analysis
of standard motifs of protein secondary structure and of proteins belonging to different fold
classes showed that all common motifs are well discriminated by the orientational distance
measure, and that the straightness parameter and the helix diameter are useful to characterise
non-ideal secondary structure elements, keeping a minimal set of parameters.
Using ScrewFit to study conformational changes in Lysozyme due to application of an
external pressure revealed different localised changes in the loop regions. The structural
changes extracted by difference distance matrix analysis from the crystallographic data could
be confirmed, giving, however, a more precise description of these changes. Concerning the
NMR structures, we find the essential conformational changes in a different position than the
authors of the reference article, although both results agree in so far, as the changes are found
in the same region. Prior to these analyses we tested that the localisation of the essential
secondary structural elements found by crystallography and NMR is confirmed.
ScrewFit allows to pinpoint secondary structure changes precisely, which is more difficult
to achieve by the standard analysis of positional differences. The reason is that the latter
might indicate important structural differences in a large region, although the corresponding
position differences are induced by one single localised change in the winding of the protein
backbone.
A point which should also be mentioned is the numerical efficiency of the quaternion-
based superposition algorithm we use as a basis of our method. The superposition of two
molecular structures can be performed in a few millisceconds [115], and this fact has been
exploited in many studies of rigid body motions in molecular systems, using the molecular
dynamics analysis package nMoldyn [120, 166]. Using the method presented in this article,
the characterisation of the secondary structure of a protein can be done in about a second on
a normal PC, and this efficiency could for example be used in database-oriented applications
and for analyses of molecular dynamics trajectories of proteins. In this context it is important
to note that the protein backbone can be completely reconstructed from the helix parameters
defined in this article. This is an interesting aspect for homology modelling. Another useful
application could be the characterisation of structural variability in different structural models
which are used to construct protein 3D structures from NMR distance data.
5.5 mathematical background 89
5.5 mathematical background
5.5.1 Quaternions
Quaternions are hypercomplex numbers which are composed by linear superposition of one
real unit element 1 and three imaginary imaginary unit elements I, J,K. The latter satisfy
the non-commutative algebra I2 = J2 = K2 = −1 and IJ = −JI = K (cycl.). An arbitrary
quaternion Q is written as Q = q01 + q1I+ q2J+ q3K, where qj ∈ R (j = 0, . . . , 3). The
component q0 is called the scalar component, and {q1,q2,q3} are the vectorial components.
It is useful to introduce the column vector q = (q ,q ,q )Tv 1 2 3 comprising the three vectorial
components of a q√uaternion. Analogously to complex numbers, the length of a quaternion is
defined as ‖Q‖ = q2 + q2 + q2 + q2 and its conjugate is given by Q∗0 1 2 3 = q01 − q1I− q2J−
q3K.
Let A and B be quaternions with components {a0,a1,a2,a3} and {b0,b1,b2,b3}, respec-
tively. The components of C = A±B are obtained by cj = aj ± bj (j = 0, . . . , 3) and from the
algebra of the imaginary elements one finds that the components of the product C = AB are
givenby   
c   a b − aT0 0 0 v · bv = ,
cv a0bv + b0av + av ∧ bv
where “∧” denotes a vector product. In general AB 6= BA. The inverse of a quaternion A is
defined as
A∗
A−1 = ‖ ‖ .A 2
Due to the non-commutative algebra of quaternions one has in general A−1B 6= BA−1.
Similarly to complex numbers of unit length, which represent rotations in the plane,
normalised quaternions represent rotations in space. Let r = (x,y, z)T a column vector
comprising the components of a radius vector ~r, let R = xI+ +yJ+ zK be the corresponding
spatial quaternion and let Q be a normalised quaternion with ‖Q‖ = 1. One finds that the
scalar component of R ′ = QRQ∗ vanishes too, and that the vectorial components of R ′ are
given by
r ′ = D · r,
where D represents the rotation matrix (6.2). The bilinear transformation R ′ = QRQ∗ repre-
sents thus a rotation in space.

5.5.2 Helix parameters in Chasles’ theorem
Chasles’ theorem can be easily proven using quaternion algebra. For this purpose we start
from Eq. (5.18) and introduce the spatial quaternions U and T⊥, representing, respectively,
the column vectors u and t⊥. Expressed in quaternions, Eq. (5.18) becomes
U−QUQ∗ = T⊥.
Multiplication with Q from the right and using that Q∗Q = 1 yields
UQ−QU = T⊥Q.
Using the multiplication rule for quaternions, the above equation can be expressed in the
form     
 −uT · q Tv   −qv · u   −t⊥ · qv − = .

Herewe can make use of relation (6.4)

from which we conclude that t⊥ · qv = 0, since t⊥ ⊥ n. We are thus left with the vector

 0   0 =  ,
2u∧ qv q0t⊥ + t⊥ ∧ qv
which can be reduced to
1( )
n∧ u = − cot(φ/2)t⊥ + n∧ t⊥ (5.29)
2
if φ 6= 2kπ (k ∈ Z). Now one can apply on both sides a vectorial multiplication with n, using
that n∧ (n∧ a) = −a for an arbitrary column vector a. This yields
1(
⊥ )
u⊥ = t⊥ + cot(φ/2)n∧ t ,
2
if one uses that n∧ (n∧ t⊥) = −t⊥ and that n∧ t⊥ = n∧ t. Relation (5.20) is thus proven.
The general solution of Eq. (5.29) has obviously the form
u(λ) = u⊥ + λn, λ ∈ R,
5.5 mathematical background 91
which shows that u⊥(λ) is the solution of minimum length.

[i] It is worth to note here that, in the context of ScrewFit algorithm, all motifs are
considered as helices, a β-strand being simply a thin left-handed helix with 2 amino acids
per turn. This fact can be easily seen in Fig. 29 where the blue cylinder represent the extent of
the helix obtained according to the definition of the C-atom of the peptide plane lying on the
helix surface, for the right-handed α-helix and the β-strand.

SCREWFIT: A NOVEL APPROACH FOR CONTINUUM PROTE IN
SECONDARY STRUCTURE ASSESSMENTS
We present a novel approach for the detection of protein secondary structure elements,
which combines a description of the protein backbone in terms of screw motions (Acta
Cryst. 62, p. 302-11 (2006)) with a statistical approach, yielding confidence ranges for the
corresponding helix parameters on the basis of natural variations. To establish these ranges
for each type of secondary structure element, we analyzed several databases of protein
structures, exhibiting each well defined structural profiles. The method allows for a continous
assessment of protein secondary structure elements and is proved to be stable with respect to
both structural variations found in NMR data and resolution problems in crystallographic
data. The comparison with other methods supports its reliability and accuracy. A structural
analysis of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor in three different crystal forms illustrates the
capability of the method to detect secondary structure elements in noisy data and to describe
at the same time small but systematic structural variations in the latter.

94 screwfit : a novel approach for continuum protein secondary structure assessments
6.1 introduction
In the last decades, a variety of newmethods has been developed for the analysis of experimen-
tal and simulation data in structural biology. One of the standard tasks is the determination
of secondary structure elements in proteins, in particular for the characterization of changes
in protein structure. Such conformational changes may be induced by binding of ligands or
by external stress, such as temperature, hydrostatic pressure, or chemical agents.
Traditionally secondary structure elements are described in terms of two torsional angles
per residue, φ and ψ, which define for each Cα-atom in the protein backbone the rotation of
the left and right peptide plane about the N−Cα and Cα −C bond, respectively [187]. This
approach is, however, not well suited to describe non-ideal secondary structure elements,
such as kinked or curved helices, which occur in any protein fold, nor does it easily allow to
detect and to describe structural changes in protein structure. In the past, different methods
have been developed to determine secondary structure elements in polypeptide chains
[106, 163, 57, 190] and to describe their geometry in more detail [9, 181, 194]. One of the
most frequently used methods is the dictionary of protein secondary structure (DSSP) which
detects secondary structure elements through typical hydrogen bond patterns [106, 89]. The
method allows in principle to distinguish eight of the most common motifs, both in secondary
and supersecondary structures, but the results are often biased by the fact that DSSP makes
assessments on protein structure using average hydrogen-bond distances as references which
implicitly include the effects of static and dynamical disorder in crystallographic data. Like
other, so-called “discrete methods”, DSSP assesses secondary structure elements on the basis
of a “true-false” decision, which follows geometrical criteria. All patterns which meet these
criteria within certain thresholds are safely detected by all discrete methods [40], but they
run into difficulties if the natural variability in the secondary structure of a given protein
is too important. Methods like DSSP are, for example, not able to reproduce the variations
between different NMR models which correlate with thermal disorder and local mobility of
structure motifs. This fact has already been observed by Andersen and coworkers [5] [25]
who presented a new method, derived from DSSP, which is called DSSPcont. The suffix
“cont” indicates that the method uses a description of protein secondary structure in terms of
a set of parameters which vary continuously in a predefined range of values. It has been
pointed out in the literature that this continuous approach can more easily distinguish between
natural conformational variations and effective changes in secondary structure profiles [5].
Indeed, Andersen and coworkers proved that a major improvement of the DSSP method
6.1 introduction 95
could be obtained simply substituting the single threshold-based definition per secondary
structure element by a quasi-continuum spectrum of assessments obtained by running the
discrete DSSP method with different hydrogen bond distance thresholds. The resulting series
of assessments leads to the final assignment probability of each residue to belong to one of
the eight DSSP classes: the three helix types (α, 310 and π); β strands; helix-turns; β bridges;
bends and not-structured loops.
With these assumptions, DSSPcont was refined in order to maintain a high consistency with
respect to the influences of small structural variations caused by the experimental setups or
by the natural thermal fluctuation of structures.
Motivated by the task to pinpoint changes in the secondary structure of proteins, we have
recently developed the ScrewFit-algorithm [114]. The algorithm uses the Cartesian atomic
coordinates of a protein as input and expresses its secondary structure in terms of screw
motions relating consecutive peptide planes in the protein backbone. In this work we present
further developments of this method which demonstrate that ScrewFit does not only allow
to quantify changes in protein configurations but can also be used to detect all common
secondary structure elements.
By construction, ScrewFit belongs to the so-called continuous methods for secondary
structure assignment, since the local helix parameters quantifying the screw motions are
continuous functions of the residue number.
Nevertheless, the ScrewFit method proposes a new approach to the continuous assignments as
it does not relate to any threshold-based definition but only to simple geometrical criteria that
define the set of parameters. The latter run over continuous ranges of values whose interpre-
tation is not biased by an a priori division into classes and which are simply obtained from an
empirical observation of the natural variations of the parameters in some appropriate protein
structure databases. Moreover, this approach does not limit the values of the parameters which
can vary beyond the ranges found for the most common secondary structure elements and
still be useful to finely characterize the secondary level of uncommon structural configuration.
In the following sections we will first present the ScrewFit-algorithm and then we will
show that structure definitions obtained by this algorithm are as precise as those obtained by
the DSSP discrete method and are less biased by finite resolution of crystallographic data.
96 screwfit : a novel approach for continuum protein secondary structure assessments
In a second application we will compare ScrewFit with the DSSPcont method mentioned
above in order to verify the stability of our set of parameters in respect to the variations
observed in NMR models due to experimental technique and thermal fluctuations.
Finally, as an example of a typical application, we will show the secondary structure profile
of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) in its three different crystal forms and we will
compare the results with those detected with DSSPcont. This example will be useful to
illustrate the advantages of this novel approach which allows to make assessments on protein
secondary structure and also quantitatively characterize all changes it can undergo as an
effect of different external conditions.
6.2 methods
6.2.1 The ScrewFit algorithms
To synthetically describe protein secondary structure, we use the algorithm ScrewFit, which is
based on quaternion superposition fits for molecular structures [50, 115, 116] and Chasles’
theorem on rigid-body displacements [33, 32]. In this section we sketch the main features of
the method and refer to [114] for more details.
In the following two consecutive peptide planes A and B, containing the atoms {O,C,N},
are considered as rigid bodies. The latter are superimposed by minimizing the target function
∑3
m(q) = (D · xα − x ′ 2α) , (6.1)
α=1
where {x } and {x ′α α} are the atomic positions of the reference (the atoms {O,C,N} in plane A)
and the target structure (plane B), respectively.
The symbol D denotes an orthogonal matrix describing a proper rotation . Both coordinate
sets are defined with respect to a reference point, which is chosen to be the position of
atom C in the respective peptide plane {O,C,N}. Using the fact that a rotation matrix can
6.2 methods 97
be expressed in the components of a normalized quaternion q ≡ {q0,q1,q2,q3}, where
q2 + q2 + q2 + q20 1 2 3 = 1[4], 

2(−q q + q q 2 2 2 20 2 1 3) 2(q0q1 + q2q3) q0 + q3 − q1 − q2
the function (6.1) is to be minimized with respect to these four parameters. As demonstrated
in previous work [50, 115, 116], the constrained minimization problem can be mapped onto
an eigenvector problem for a positive semi-definite matrix M ≡M({x , x ′α α}),
M · q = λq, (6.3)
whose eigenvalues λj = m(qj) are four possible errors of the superposition fit between the
two peptide planes, defined by (6.1). The smallest eigenvalue is the solution for the optimal fit,
and the components of the corresponding eigen-quaternion describe the relative orientation
of {x ′α} with respectto {xα}. Writing
q ≡ q0  cos(φ/2)=  . (6.4)

one sees that the resulting quaternion defines the rotation angle φ and the corresponding
rotation axis n, which is at the same time the direction of the screw motion, according to the
theorem of Chasles. The proof of the latter can be elegantly given by using the quaternion
calculus [114]. The largest eigenvalue λmax describes the “worst” superposition and gives
the maximal Euclidean distance between the two peptide planes. We use the latter to define a

To characterize protein secondary structure we use the following parameters:
1. The orientational distance of consecutive peptide planes, which is defined in Eq. (6.5).
2. The radius of the cylindrical surface on which the reference atom (atom C) moves
performing th√e screw motion between two consecutive peptide planes,
|t⊥|
ρ = 1+ cot2(φ/2). (6.6)

Here t⊥ is the component of the vector t relating the C-atoms, which is perpendicular
to the rotation axis defined by n.

σ = µTi i · µi+1, (6.7)
where
R⊥i+1 −R

and R⊥i is the point on the helix axis, which is closest to the C-atom of peptide plane i.
The straightness gives information about the curvature of a secondary structure element.
Figure 30(Panel A) gives an illustration of the helix (screw motion) parameters defined above.
By definition the C-atoms of the peptide planes are on the surface of the cylinder defining
the envelope of the screw motion. Figure 30 (Panel B) gives a sketch of a typical ScrewFit
profile of a protein (in this figure, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor).

triangles formed by the atoms {O,C,N} of the peptide planes define the local helix structure

the side-chains. The radius of the cylinder shown in figure defines the radius ρ of the screw
motion relating the two consecutive peptide planes. Panel B) A typical ScrewFit profile for

The colored stripes on the bottom of the figure indicate the secondary structure motifs
determined by DSSP method (β-strands: blue; α-helices: red; 3− 10-helices: green). Vertical
stripes superimposed on ScrewFit plots represent motifs detected by the latter method
(same coloring scheme as for the DSSP).
6.2 methods 99
6.2.2 Availability
ScrewFit is implemented in a Python open-source code which uses several modules from the
Molecular Modelling Toolkit library [81]1. A Web-based implementation is under construction.
6.2.3 Databases
We created two subsets of the SCOP structural classification with “all-α” and “all-β” pro-
teins [145], which contain protein domains whose sequence have less than 40% of identity
and whose structure elements are essentially α-helices and β-strands, respectively. For this
purpose we used a subset of the ASTRAL [31] database which contains PDB-style files for
each SCOP classified domain. From the original database, all structures with non-canonical
atom notations were corrected or erased.
After these reductions we obtained two databases:
- A, containing 1027 all-α domains
- B, containing 1336 all-β domains
Every item into these databases is made only by the structurally significant domains and
not by the whole proteins structure. The distribution for the ∆ and ρ parameters obtained
with these databases are represented in Figure 31.
To validate the variation of the ScrewFit parameters and their accuracy obtained by the
approach described in the next section we will use three other sets of proteins with a limited
overlap with our original databases and with a greater structural heterogeneity. For this
purpose we chose:
- C, a subset from the database PDBSelect25[84], containing 2144 chains with sequence
homology lower than 25% and non-redundant folds
- D, a subset obtained directly from the PDB by the culling server PISCES [203][204],
containing 2477 chains with sequence homology lower than 25% and experimental
resolution in the range 0.5− 2.0A˙
- E, a subset also obtained via PISCES, containing 1829 chains with sequence homology
lower than 25% and experimental resolution in the range 2.1− 3.5A˙
1 Both codes are freely available at http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/software.html
100 screwfit: a novel approach for continuum protein secondary structure assessments
Each entry in these databases C,D,E is chosen according the same rules which were applied
to constitute databases A and B. The database C is intended for reproduction of most of the
structural heterogeneity present in the whole PDB database.
Finally, a finer comparison between ScrewFit and DDSPcont will be performed to verify
the consistency of assessments made by ScrewFit. For this purpose, we will refer to the same
database of NMR entries used in the original work by Andersen et al. [5]. We will call it :
- F, containing 211 chains from NMR structures each containing at least ten models.
6.3 results and discussion
6.3.1 Evaluation of natural parameters
The algorithm described above has already been tested in [114] for model structures of
polypeptides taken from the Jena Library of Biological Macromolecules (available at 2) and
the resulting parameters will be considered as ideal values in the following. Comparison with
values obtained from real protein structures shows that the parameters fluctuate substantially
around the ideal values, even in well definined structural motifs [114]. Secondary structure
should, therefore, be associated with a range of possible values of the three parameters. In
order to find these ranges we have applied ScrewFit to the large number of protein domains
of known and well classified structures, which belong to databases A and B (see Figure 31 ).
Each peak of the distributions corresponds to the dominant structural pattern in the respec-

parameter which is considered. To quantify the latter we fitted the dominant peaks in each
distribution by a Gaussian function,

Here m is the position of the peak and s its width, which is to be compared with the
parameters for model structures listed in Table 13.
The reader should be aware that 310 and π helices are sometimes present in all-α domains,
but they are clearly under-represented in our database A. As shown in [114], these secondary
structure elements can however be unambiguously distinguished by ScrewFit applied on
their ideal structures. The same is true for the extended conformation with respect to the

database presents an additional peak at values far from the dominant one. This fact is due to
the presence of some residues in the extended conformation and reverse turns (α, β and γ
type) in both databases.

The hollow bins represent the ideal values reprinted from ??. The color-scheme used is: red

and brown for π-helices.
Figure 32 shows the normalized distributions of the parameters ∆ and ρ obtained from the
application of ScrewFit to the database C introduced in the previous section. Despite their
origin from a wider spectrum of structural domains, these distributions are very similar to a
superposition of those obtained from A and B. Interestingly, the peaks from C are also very
close to those from A and B which are reported in Figure 32 as full-colored bins.
The ideal values reported in Table 13 and obtained from previous works [114] are also reported
in Figure 32 as hollows bins. Here it is worth noting that 310 and π helices, which were
under-represented in our original databases A and B, have ideal values slightly different from
the natural value obtained for the α-helices6.5. This observation supports the assumption that
even using these ideal values one can easily characterize an helicoidal pattern and distinguish
if it belongs to one of the three most frequent classes.
As a whole, these facts confirm that the empirical definitions made for structural elements
and summarized in Table 13 allows to distinguish the structural elements in several types of
protein folds.

6.3.2 Reliability and consistency of ScrewFit assignments
In the following we want to confirm the reliability of the natural parameters in Table 13,
comparing ScrewFit to other methods and with respect to the refinement of experimental
resolution.
It is worth noting here that a wide variety of methods have been used in the past to make
discrete secondary structure assessments based on different approach: intra-backbone hy-
drogen bonds (DSSP), expert assignements and backbone dihedral angles (STRIDE[57]),
Cα coordinates (P-SEA[123] and DEFINE[163]) and protein curvature (P-curve [181]). Ob-
servations made by Colloc’h et al. [40] showed that DSSP, DEFINE and P-curve share the
same assessment in 63% of cases whereas DSSP and STRIDE agree for 96%. As for several
reasons, DSSP is commonly considered the standard reference in the field, we will limit our
comparison to it, in its discrete (simply DSSP in the following) and continuous (DSSPcont, in
the following) forms, and two other methods with different approach and assume that all
other comparisons can be inferred using the results showed in [40].
In their original work, Kabsh and Sander [106] applied DSSP on three different crystallo-
graphic structures of decreasing resolution from 1.5 A to 3.0 A in order to study its accurancy
against experimental resolutions. In this work we use the same three structures to compare
our method with DSSP and with the method by Levitt and Greer (LG) [128] also referred in
[106]. The latter is another method based on distance dependent definitions of the secondary
structure motifs and all results obtained from its application are simply reprinted from
reference [106] . The reader should be aware that two of these structures have now been
superseded by new and more accurated ones. Here we use the older structures to refer
directly to the original work by Kabsch and Sander as this will not affect our conclusions.
Nevertheless we also compare the ScrewFit analysis on one of these structures ( PDB code:
2ADK ) with its homologue obtained by the more refined structure ( PDB code: 3ADK) to
make further assessments of the effects of the experimental resolution on our method.
Table 14 shows the results of ScrewFit on pancreatic trypsin inhibitor at 1.5 Å resolution (PDB
code: 3PTI) and cytochrome c550 at 2.5 Å resolution (PDB code: 155C).
The comparison of assignments ScrewFit with those taken from [106] for DSSP and LG,
shows that the three methods are globally equivalent in detecting secondary structure motifs
on the structure at higher resolution but some relevant discrepancies among them begin to
appear at the 2.5 Å resolution structure. In particular, this fact is evident in the region 26-31
of cytochrome c550, where LG and DSSP do not find the same β-strand and ScrewFit detects

106 screwfit: a novel approach for continuum protein secondary structure assessments
In both cases assignments made by DSSP and DSSPcont did not show any significant
differences. A more detailed comparison with respect to experimental resolution is made in
Table 15. The accuracy of ScrewFit assignments on adelynate kinase structure at different
resolution ( PDB codes: 2ADK and 3ADK) was compared with those made by the means of
three other methods: DSSP, STRIDE and P-SEA.
Globally the effects of resolution on these methods are the same and only some discrepancies
in N- and C- edges were encountered. This fact is already well known in literature as an
artifact due to the different definitions [40].
Nevertheless, a more accurate analysis of this comparison shows different response of each
method to the improved resolution. Firstly, at low resolution the assignments made by
ScrewFit overlap very well with those made by DSSP except for a slightly deformed β-strand
in 35-38 which makes ScrewFit assessment quite uncertain. Secondly, DSSP and ScrewFit
detect also two α-helices instead of one unique helix in the region 143-167. This outcome is
confirmed for the four methods at higher resolution.
Additionally, from Table 15 is also evident that P-SEA and ScrewFit improve their accuracy
with resolution detecting two new β-strands in 65-68 and 109-112.
These results confirm those previously shown in reference [114] and suggest that ScrewFit
performance is equivalent to those obtained by the more refined distance-dependent methods
if it is applied on a structure at low resolution. If the resolution is improved on the same
structure, ScrewFit shows instead a significant conservative refinement with respect to the
lower resolution structure and it also adds some new motifs with partial convergence with
the common distance-dependent methods.
To confirm the consistency of ScrewFit assignements with respect to the experimental
resolution, we plotted the normalized distribution of values obtained for the parameters
∆ and ρ calculated over all structures in databases D (resolution less than 2.0Å) and E (
resolution between 2.1Åand 3.5Å). As shown in Figure 33 the effect of a better resolution is
the slight narrowing of some peaks in the distributions, in particular for those corresponding
to the α-helices values. Interestingly, assignments on β strands seem to be not affected by
the experimental resolution. It is worth noting instead that although the shape of the peak
distributions slightly changed, the position of their maxima stands unchanged. As a whole,
the outcome of the comparison showed in Table 15 and the calculation over the databases D
and E proved that the efficiency of ScrewFit assessments is globally quite insensitive to the
experimental resolution with which the structural data were obtained.

6.3.3 Comparison with DSSPcont
As we mentioned in the Introduction, the main problem with the most common methods for
the secondary structure assignments is the use of threshold-based definitions which recast
the structural conformation heterogeneity of protein backbones into eight or less classes
without accounting for the effect of the natural variations that could occur into the structures
due, for example, to thermal fluctuations.
Andersen and coworkers [5] presented an improved version of the DSSP method in which
the discrete assignments were substituted by continuous ones obtained from the former
ones variating of the hydrogen-bond distance thresholds defined for each of the eight DSSP
structural classes. The efficency of DSSPcont method in capturing the effects of thermal
fluctuations in NMR structure models has been shown to be higher than that of the discrete
DSSP [5].
Here we discuss the consistency of the ScrewFit assessments with the same criteria used by
Andersen and coworkers and in particular we verify the stability of our set of parameters
over the database F.
For each NMR structure in F, we first calculated (for both parameters ∆ and ρ) the
standard deviation of values over all the models. We then grouped these results when the
corresponding mean values of the parameters fell within one of the ranges defined in Table
13. The averages over these groups gave an estimation of the stability of parameters ∆ and ρ
108 screwfit: a novel approach for continuum protein secondary structure assessments
as a function of their values and could be compared to those obtained for DSSPcont in [5].
Results for α-helices, β-strands and extended conformation are presented in Table 6.3.3.

root mean square deviation from average assignments. Value for DSSPcont are reprinted
from [5]. Lines labeled with def refer to amplitudes of the ranges presented in Table 13 with
respect to the corresponding parameter’s value. Extended conformation is given with the
same values of β-strands when a differentiation between the two cannot be made. All values

ScrewFit -ρ - def 11.9 44.0 44.0
ScrewFit -∆ - NMR 9.1 4.4 8.2
ScrewFit -∆ - def 7.6 7.2 7.1
The first outcome of this analysis is that consistency of assignments in ScrewFit seems to
be higher than in DSSPcont only for parameter ∆ and not for ρ. In fact, for the latter, the
large deviation from the average values is clearly due to the lack of two distinct ranges for
β-strands and for extended conformations. This is a direct effect of using continuous ranges
of natural values for the definition of secondary structure elements and these differences
between parameter consistency prove that in ScrewFit the combination of the two parameters,
∆ and ρ, (combined with σ) is essential to make precise assessments.
Moreover, Table 6.3.3 shows that, independently of the type of structural element, the root
mean square differences for NMR models is coherent with the relative amplitudes of the
ranges defined in Table 13. Nevertheless, it is worth to note that the use of ranges did not
permit the same calculation for less represented structural elements like 310 and π helices
and the comparison with DSSPcont with respect to the consistency of assignments remains
incomplete. Corresponding work is in progress in order to obtain comparison also on the
other DSSP structural classes.
6.3 results and discussion 109
6.3.4 Application
In the following we will show a simple application of our method. This example underlines
the combined approach which allows assessments on the protein secondary structure and
a quantitative characterization of its changes within the same tool and without any further
data treatment.
BPTI Crystal forms
As reported in our previous work [114], ScrewFit can be used to pinpoint small conformational
changes due to several causes ranging from different experimental techniques to external
environment changes like, for example, ligand binding or variation in pH. As an example we
will consider here the case of the three different crystal forms of bovine pancreatic trypsin
inhibitor (BPTI) which are known to be originated by different pH condition: pH values lower
than 9.35 favor the form I and II crystals whereas higher pH values favor the form III.
These three different crystal structures induce some small changes in protein conformation
as reported in [209, 210]. In the original works, the authors compared the three structures
of BPTI by means of inter-atomic distances in the backbone and/or in the side-chains. The
outcome of this type of analysis was the finding of several local changes induced by the
different crystal forms. Nevertheless, a detailed structural characterization of those changes
were not possible.
Here, we will first analyze the secondary structure assignments made by ScrewFit on the
structure obtained from the crystal form I and we will then discuss the differences with the
other two structures.
For the determination of secondary structure motifs, we confront again the ScrewFit
parameters with the secondary structure elements found by the DSSPcont method. The
results are shown in Figure 30 (Panel B). The motifs found by DSSPcont are shown on the
bottom of the figure. We used the same color scheme for both methods: red for α-helices,
blue for β-strands and green for 3-10 helices. Visual inspection shows that most of the motifs
found by DSSPcont correspond to the regions where the ScrewFit parameters are enclosed
by the natural variations. Interestingly, our method is able to identify very well the α-turn
between the two beta strands 19-25 and 30-36. These regions are highlighted in Figure 30
(Panel B) with colored vertical bands. Minor discrepancies can, however, be observed in some
regions, expecially in the extreme residues of each element. In particular, ScrewFit finds that
the assignment of the 310 between residues 3 and 6, is quite uncertain due to the highly

and α-helices (colored in red).
6.3 results and discussion 111
deformed C-terminus which is characterized by abnormally high values for this structural
element in parameters ∆ and ρ and by the value of σ very close to zero in residue 6 which
evidently stands for a kink in the backbone profile.
Let us now look at the effects of the three crystal forms on the structure of the BPTI. Figure
34 shows the parameters calculated in the three different conformations of the protein. In
each plot, the horizontal stripes indicate the range of variation for the ScrewFit parameters
as found in databases A and B (the usual color-code is used here: α-helix highlighted in
red; β-strands highlighted in blue; 310-helix highlighted in green). In the original works the
authors reported some major differences between form I and form II in the regions 15-19,
26-29, 39-41 and 47-50 and between form II and form III mainly localized in residues 15 and 26.
It is worth noting that deviations of backbone close to residue 15 are particularly interesting,
since this residue is part of the active site of the BPTI. The application of ScrewFit to the
three structures confirms some the differences mentioned above and allows them to be better
characterized. In particular, changes around both residue 15 and 26 show major discrepancies
between the conformation in crystal form III and the other two. In residue 15, parameter ∆
changes, from form I and II to form III, toward values closer to an helix-turn conformation
but the absence of equivalent changes in the other two parameters proves that this change is
only due to a different relative orientation of the peptide planes related to a reorientation of
the side-chains bewteen residues 15 and 16. The analysis of parameters’ values for residue
26 leads to similar conclusions. A confirmation of these findings can be done with a direct
visualization of the structure as showed in Figure 34. Additionally, ScrewFit reveals also a
difference between the crystal form II and the other two at the C-terminus of the α-helix
in region 47-53. In this case the parameter σ shows that in forms II the helix axis is rather
straight whereas in the other two forms it clearly bends.
The application of DSSPcont on the same structures confirmed that the major differences
between crystal form I and crystal form II were localized in the regions around residues 15
and 26 where it is reported an higher probability, in form II rather than in form I, of having
respectively an not-structured and a helix-turn conformation. Nevertheless, DSSPcont does
not find any relevant change between crystal form II and form III which was detected by
ScrewFit.
112 screwfit: a novel approach for continuum protein secondary structure assessments
6.4 conclusion
We presented the ScrewFit method for the analysis of the secondary structure level of proteins,
which describes the latter in terms of local helix parameters obtained by the screw motions
relating consecutive peptide planes. By construction, this method represents, ipso facto, a
new approach to the so-called continuous methods for the secondary structure assessments
because it does not relate to beforehand threshold-based definitions but only to geometrical
criteria which are verified a posteriori on natural secondary structure elements.
To establish confidence levels for the definition of all types of elements, we applied our
method to different well defined selections of protein structures. The natural variations in
parameters of ScrewFit have been shown to be coherent with the ideal values obtained in a
precedent work.
We have then confirmed the reliability of our definitions by applying our method on a
heterogeneous set of proteins with different type of folds. In order to show the efficiency and
accuracy of ScrewFit we confronted it to other methods, in particular to DSSP and DSSPcont.
The outcome of this comparison showed that ScrewFit can be considered as accurate as
DSSP/DSSPcont in function of crystallographic resolution. As an example, we analyzed the
three different crystal forms of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor by means of ScrewFit.
This application has shown that ScrewFit finds essentially the same structural elements
as DSSP, but gives also a more detailed description of them, leading in some cases to a
different assessment of secondary structure elements. It is worth noting that the method is
also shown to be efficient in detecting some kind of reverse turns and random coils. Further
improvements to permit more detailed assignments also of these motifs are the subject of
work in progress.
As a whole, with the same application we showed that ScrewFit is able to pinpoint small
structural changes and to give a global view of the structural rearrangements of the protein
as a response to external changes.
In this context, another important feature of the method is the fact of combining in the same
tool a method for detecting secondary structure and a way to find and characterize any
induced structural change.
It should be mentioned that while ScrewFit was developed for the analysis of protein
secondary structures, with some minor improvements, it may also be used to characterize the
protein supersecondary motifs and the folds of DNA and RNA molecules. Corresponding
work is also in progress.

[i] It can be easily verified that the ranges found for the parameter for ρ in α-helices and
in 310-helices are fully compatible with those obtained by Barlow and Thornton [9] [ see
section 5.3.2] on a rather smaller set of ∼ 100 structures.

RESULTS
As stated in the introduction, one of the principal aims of this work was the characterization
of both dynamical and structural aspects in protein adaptation to environmental conditions.
In the present chapter, results obtained in this thesis for the particular case of the IF6s will be
presented and discussed.
After a summary on the samples used in this work and the environmental conditions
investigated, the discussion will focus on the analysis of structural and dynamical effects of
pressure and temperature on each sample. The results will be used to determine both local
and global effects of the environmental conditions to IF6 homologues. The link between the
assessment of both types of effects will be assured by the complementarity of the insights
obtained by molecular dynamics (MD) and quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS).
The samples that have been studied either by MD simulations or by QENS experiments are:
- aIF6: the extremophile IF6 homologue from Methanococcus Jannaschii.
- aIF6-HTag: the extremophile homologue with the supplemental N-terminal poly-
histidine tag (HTag). This sample was used in the high pressure QENS experiments and
was needed during the production phase in order to enhance the expression protocol
yield.
- eIF6: the modeled mesophile IF6 homologue from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
- eIF6-NoCTAIL: the mesophile homologue with C-terminal cleaved.
The different environmental conditions used in MD are listed in Table 17, whereas those
used in QENS measurements are shown in Table 18. It is worth noting here that the number
and the variety of experimental measurements was largely constrained by several technical
facts as will be exposed later in this chapter. Nevertheless, the comparison to results obtained
from MD were however possible through a limited set of measurements. The environmental
conditions listed in Tables 17 and 18 will be selectively chosen in the next section to present
different aspects. Unless explicitly mentioned, the results shown here were obtained from

7.1 effects of pressure and temperature change on if6s structure
The following section presents a study of the structural response of IF6s to changes in
pressure and temperature.
7.1 effects of pressure and temperature change on if6s structure 117
When high pressure and high temperature are applied to protein solution, one of the main
effects that one would expect to see is the change in molecular volume and molecular surface
exposed to the solvent.
In Figure 36 is shown the volume change induced in aIF6 and eIF6 by a pressure change
equivalent to 500bar at 300K and 350K. Here the molecular volume was estimated by the
volume related to the surface accessible to solvent molecules. The extremophile IF6 structure
seems to be less sensitive to environmental changes than its mesophilic counterpart. This
observation is also corroborated by Figure 37 which shows the variation of the radius of
gyration (Rgyr)in eIF6 and aIF6, respectively. This quantity, defined by
N
1 ∑
R = (R −R )2gyr i CM , (7.1)
N
i
is the root mean square distance of atoms from the protein center of mass (RCM). Although
Rgyr is commonly used to give insight into the global shape of proteins, here it cannot be
used to give an exact representation of IF6s, as the latter has a torus-like shape (see Figure 35)
and the atomic mean distance does not distinguish between changes in either the internal
or the external radius of the tours. Nonetheless, Rgyr can be used to give a qualitative
representation of shape changes in IF6s. Indeed Rgyr of aIF6 varies in a narrow range from
16.45 to 16.75 Å, indicating that the protein structure is rather insensitive to environmental
changes. In eIF6, Rgyr does not significantly change at 300K when pressure is applied
whereas it shows a very large variation when pressure is applied at high temperature (350K).
Interestingly radial values of aIF6 at extremophilic natural conditions (350K and ∼ 500bar) are
very similar to those of eIF6 in mesophilic natural conditions (300K and 1bar).
Similar observations can be made with respect to the surface accessible area (SASA) shown
in Figure 38. The differences in variation of SASA between the two homologues, at 350K
reveals that the changes found in Rgyr of eIF6 must be mainly related to the increase of the
total surface exposed to the solvent.
7.1.1 Local effects
The local effects produced by pressure and temperature on IF6s structures can be probed
using the root mean square fluctuations RMSF(i) = 〈R (t) − 〈R 〉〉2i i , where i can refer to
either an atom or a group of atoms (e.g., backbones or sidechains ); in the latter case an

The RMSF of carbon Cα in aIF6’s backbone (Figure 39) shows that at 300K atomic fluc-
tuations of residues are slightly reduced by pressure on the whole structure but a more
significant variation is found in the region 80-90 . The latter region corresponds to the α-helix
of one of the five pseudo-symmetric subdomains which composed the IF6 structure. No
7.1 effects of pressure and temperature change on if6s structure 121
significant differences are found between RMSF at 250bar and 500bar whereas at 350K the
same region 80-90 shows RMSF increased by pressure. Moreover, as one would expect the
general effect of temperature is to increase RMSF.
The changes due to pressure found in aIF6 are not present in eIF6 where instead RMSF in
region 80-90 is increased by temperature but reduced by pressure.
In both cases, these results lead to the conviction that pressure and temperature can induce
large changes in the exposure to the solvent of the α-helix in region 80-90 which results in a
higher or lower RMSF of Cα atoms in the region. This observation is supported by visual
inspection of both aIF6 and eIF6 sequences which reveals that the α-helix is highly charged
and thus it has an high propensity for interaction with solvent.
Figure 40 shows that eIF6, at both 300K and 350K, has an higher baseline for Cαs fluctuations,
probably due to the presence of the C-terminal tail of 21 amino acids (CTAIL) which could
transmit supplemental fluctuations to the rest of the protein structure. In the same context, it
is worth noting that at high temperature this baseline is particularly increased for residues
from 100 to 220, as shown in Figure 40.
7.1.2 Secondary structure changes
Even though the calculation of RMSF allowed several qualitative assessments on the effects
of pressure and temperature on IF6s’ structures, a finer method is necessary to quantify
them. For this purpose, the ScrewFit method will be used here to characterize the response
of IF6s to the environmental changes. In particular the method will be used to analyze the
molecular structures obtained by time-averaging of the atomic trajectories issued from the MD
simulations in order to make assessments on the local flexibility of the secondary structure of
IF6.
The first application of ScrewFit on the time-averaged structure of both aIF6 and eIF6 at 300K
and 1bar allows to distinguish the very similar secondary structure of the five subdomains
which compose the IF6 structure (Figure 41 shows the aIF6’s profile). The inspection by eye
allows the five motifs to be found through their regular profiles. Here, the discussion will be
limited to the motif in the region 52-100 but the same conclusions can be obtained also from
any of the other structural subdomains.
Groft and coworkers [66], who reported the presence of subdomains in a five-axis pseudo-
symmetry in IF6 structures, stated also that the almost invariant secondary structure profile of
these subdomains was made of a long α-helix, a shorter one (alternatively a 310-helix was also
122 results
found) and three β-strands. Here the analysis of the orientational distance and of the radius
of the helix of screw motion, seems to confirm the presence of a tight α-helix or more likely
a 310-helix in residues 57-60 followed by two β-strands in the region 60-75 (See previous
chapters for reference values). The latter have, however, a very variable straightness, meaning
that they have a very curved form, as one can verify by visual inspection on molecular
structure.
Residues 78-90 clearly form a long and straight α-helix as evident from the comparison
of values of the three parameters. Nonetheless, the C-terminus of this long α-helix shows
a curved region as shown again by the straightness parameter which attains values close
to zero. This result confirms and completes the observation made on the RMSF in the
region around residue 90 in both aIF6 and eIF6. Indeed, variations found in the RMSF
must correspond in changes in the curvature of the C-terminal region of the α-helix. The
subdomain ends with a rather straight short β-strand from residue 90 to 100.

7.1 effects of pressure and temperature change on if6s structure 123
Once the profile of IF6 secondary structure is characterized by ScrewFit parameters,
one can observe the changes of the same parameters on the effect of high pressure and
temperature. Nevertheless, as reported in [22], a direct comparison of the structures of eIF6
and aIF6 will not be possible due to the presence of several deletions and insertions in
sequences of both homologues which do not permit a direct structural alignment of the two
IF6s without gaps.
Figures 42 and 43 show the effects of temperature and pressure on both structures by means
of differences of ScrewFit profiles. Profiles at high temperature or pressure were subtracted
from the profile at 300K and 1bar to obtain the differences shown in figures. The outcome of
the analysis of these figures is listed in the following. In both cases distinct effects due to
temperature or pressure have been observed.
aIF6
- At 350K-1bar aIF6 shows a higher value of orientational distance in region around residue
60 and between residue 120 and 130. In both cases this reflects a significant distortion of
the helical conformation without change in the local curvature of backbone as evidenced
by a rather small variation in straightness values.
- High pressure (500bar), induces a significant change in residues 90-95. The inspection of all
parameters seems to confirm that pressure induces a more curved structure and locally
residues assume a conformation more similar to the neighbor α-helix 78-90 rather than
to β-strand 90-100.
- The combination of high temperature and high pressure has another significant effect
around residue 50 where a transition towards a more curled conformation is evident
from values of orientational distance and helix radius.
eIF6
- Large variations of all parameters in the region 220-245 are clearly due to the large fluctua-
tions of CTAIL. These variations increase, as expected, with temperature.
- Different variations in the region 170-180 are shown as effects of both temperature and pres-
sure when applied separately but they are not present when a simultaneous application
of high pressure and high temperature is performed(see also Figure 44).

- Combination of high temperature and high pressure produces an evident change in all
parameters in the region 35-45 which correspond to the long α-helix of the first subdo-
main of IF6 structure. As for region 78-90 in aIF6, also here variations are related to
a major curvature of the C-terminus of the α-helix. Several different configurations of
peptide planes in region 35-45 are shown by variations in orientational distance and
helix radius.
Interestingly, changes in ScrewFit profiles of eIF6 and aIF6 appear in different regions. The
former is more affected in residues between 160 and 245 and between 1 and 50, whereas the
latter is more significantly affected in the central region 50-140.
7.1.3 Relation between local structural effects and IF6 function
Very little is known about how IF6 performs its functions. Only few insights were reported
by Basu et al [11] and by Groft et al. [66]:
• Serines 174 and 175 are found to play an essential role in nuclear localization of IF6s
which must be related to the phosphorylation of these two residues.

• Arginine 61 in eIF6 is found to close the central hollow of IF6 structure and prevent
water molecules passing throught it. This fact could have effects on the global stability
of IF6s structures.
• The C-terminal region (to be distinguished from CTAIL which is formed by residues
224-245) encompassing the evolutionarily conserved arginines and tyrosines Arg 67,
Tyr 113, Arg 223 and Tyr 202 represents an exellent candidate for the participation in a
biologically relevant protein-protein interaction. Indeed it is suggested as the binding
site for the 60S ribosomal subunit.
Some of the structural changes found in this work and induced by pressure and/or
temperature involved the residues mentioned above, meaning that the corresponding
structural re-arrangements could be related to the functional adaptation of IF6.
In particular it was reported that the region including the two serines 174 and 175 undergoes
structural changes at high pressure (Figure 44) and high temperature separately but it assumes
its normal configuration when both pressure and temperature are increased. This result seems
to be crucial for the assessment of the function of eIF6 under extreme conditions similar to
those of warm deep seas. The C-terminal is obviously also largely influenced by the presence
of CTAIL which induces fluctuations in eIF6 that are not present in aIF6. Also this fact
will be used in the following to discuss the ability of eIF6 to adapt its function to extreme
environments. As a whole, aIF6 seems to show a higher stability with respect to the change
of the thermodynamic variables. Nonetheless, it shows some significant changes in backbone
conformation in regions apparently not related to protein function.
Finally, the comparison of RMSF and ScrewFit parameters for Arg 61 did not give any
significant result in structural changes on the time scales used in this work.
7.1.4 Comparison between ScrewFit profiles of eIF6 and eIF6-NoCTAIL
In order to better understand the role of CTAIL in (de)stabilizing eIF6 structure, a supple-
mental MD simulation was performed on eIF6’s structure without its C-terminal tail. The
protocol used for this simulation was mentioned in the chapter on system setups.
Comparison of ScrewFit profile of eIF6-NoCTAIL (Figure 45) with that of complete eIF6, reveals
the absence of variations that characterized eIF6 in the previous paragraphs. Moreover, the
variations in ScrewFit parameters in eIF6-NoCTAIL are more similar and closer in sequence
localization to those shown for aIF6.
7.1 effects of pressure and temperature change on if6s structure 127
The observations made above lead to the conclusion that CTAIL could play a important
role in structural adaptation of IF6 to extreme environment. In particular it seems that the
presence of this C-terminal tail induces thermal fluctuations to the backbone of the rest of
IF6 structure leading to a lower protein stability. As will be shown later in this chapter, the
effects of pressure and temperature induced through CTAIL fluctuations do not cause only
structural changes but also a different scheme of IF6 dynamical response to environmental
changes.

7.1.5 Comparison between ScrewFit profiles of aIF6 and aIF6-HTag
As recalled at the start of this chapter, high pressure QENS experiments were performed on
aIF6 with an attached supplemental N-terminal tail of 21 amino acids (HTag). This tail was
essential to improve the yield of protein production. The same sample (aIF6-Htag), was also
studied by MD simulations to make comparison with experimental data possible. aIF6-HTag
Straightness Helix Radius Orientational Distance
128 results
time-averaged structure was initially analyzed by ScrewFit in order to identify differences
with other samples and to verify the structural effect of the HTag on the protein itself.
ScrewFit differences between structures of aIF6-HTag at different pressures and temperatures
are shown in Figure 46. Here the beginning of the residue sequence was shifted to -20 in
order to maintain the usual numbers in the conserved part of the structure.
First of all, the effect of the HTag is clearly present in all parameters as large variations in the
region from -21 to 0 but in contrast to the effects produced by CTAIL on eIF6 structure, here
these changes are localized only in the region of the HTag and do not propagate over the rest
of the structure.
Moreover, the region between residues 40 and 50 seems to undergo the same changes found
in aIF6, meaning that this region is intrinsically sensitive to environmental changes probably
due to its exposure to solvent.

Finally, it is worth noting that the major change in the whole structure happens in region
110-115 and is present almost in the same way in all conditions. This fact suggests that the

latter is a structural arrangement compatible only with the structure at 300K-1bar.
The outcome of this comparison of ScrewFit profiles as well as the others was that both
aIF6 and eIF6 are largely affected by the possible presence of a additional sequence of amino
acids either in their N- or C- termini. Nevertheless, the effects produced strictly depend on
the rest of the protein structure and can be very different.
7.1.6 Elastic Incoherent Structure Factor
As stated in the chapter on Material and Methods, the Elastic Incoherent Strcture Factor gives
insights into the configurational space volume explored by atomic motions in macromolecules.
As for other scattering functions, in the case of biomolecules, also the EISF is largely dominated
by hydrogen contributions and it can be approximated as due to the motions of only one
single representative scattering atom.
The EISF has already been used widely to characterize the structural "flexibility" of proteins
because it can be directly related to atomic mean square displacement (MSD). Indeed, for
small values of the momentum transfer, it can be proved that the equation 2.42 can be
approximated by the following expression [15]:
EISF(q) = lim∞ I(q, t) = exp(−q2〈x2〉), (7.2)t→
which has Gaussian form. In reality the Gaussian approximation holds strictly only for
q→ 0 [15]. The above equation reveals that 〈x2〉 can be directly obtained by EISF via:
〈x2〉 = − ln(EISF[q])/q2 (7.3)
Using equation 2.42, the EISF of aIF6 and eIF6 have been calculated. Here and in the
following, the quantities of interest are calculated only on the evolutionary "conserved" part
of the IF6, i.e. on the region 1-224, filtering out the contribution of the C-terminal tail. A first
comparison of EISF from aIF6 ( Figure 47 - Panel A) and eIF6 ( Figure 47 - Panel B) underlines
two main differences between the two samples:
- In both cases pressure makes the slope of EISF only slightly change whereas temperature
has a much more evident effect
- Even though aIF6 shows qualitatively the same behavior as eIF6, its variations due to
pressure are very limited. Moreover, at high temperature (350K), EISFs at 1bar and
500bar are almost identical.
130 results
A) B)
Figure 47: Elastic Incoherent Structure Factor for aIF6 and eIF6.
Looking at these results, one would conclude that the difference between the two samples
is mainly related to their stiffness/softness character [216], but the direct comparison of EISFs
in Figure 48 shows also another interesting outcome: EISFs of aIF6 at high temperature are
very similar to those of eIF6 at 300K. This means that configurational spaces explored have
the same extent in both samples when they are both in their natural conditions.
Furthermore, EISF from eIF6 at high temperature shows a much more rapid decrease as a
function of the momentum transfer with respect to the other EISFs. Another interpretation
for this result is given by the atomic position fluctuation, 〈x2〉, obtained from equation 7.3
and shown in Figure 48 (Panel B). From this figure it seems evident that atomic fluctuations
can be analyzed as function of the momentum transfer. This does, however, not necessarily
mean that the Gaussian approximation given above does not hold, but only that it is not
compatible with the assumption of one single representative scattering atom. It has, in fact,
been shown that the Gaussian model can represent the EISF of a protein up to moderate q
values, since such a model can account for motional heterogeneity.
The 〈x2〉 attains larger values for eIF6 at high temperature (at both pressures), meaning that
fluctuations increase and involve the motion of rather large group of atoms or structural
domains (q < 20nm−1). It is also worth noting here that the EISF (and the corresponding
〈x2〉) from eIF6 at 300K-500bar superpose slightly better than the one at eIF6-300K-1bar to
aIF6 1bar/500bar.

characterization of eif6-noctail and aif6-htag structure and dynamics
In this chapter, an hypothesis on the characterization of structural and dynamical properties
of eIF6 and aIF6 is proposed. In particular the comparison of different EISFs will be used to
assess the existence of corresponding states between aIF6 and eIF6.
Here, similar characterization will be sketched also for eIF6-NoCTAIL and aIF6-HTag in
order to use them latter in a more detailed discussion of the results.
EISFs from aIF6-HTag are compared to those of eIF6 and aIF6 at different temperature and
pressure and plotted in Figure 49. Interestingly, this result, together with the analysis made
by ScrewFit in the previous sections, shows that aIF6-HTag has the same structural properties
as eIF6. An opposite result was obtained from comparison of EISFs from eIF6-NoCTAIL with
both eIF6 and aIF6 (Figure 50). Here, it seems that, even though EISFs from eIF6-NoCTAIL
are very similar to those from aIF6, they show that the former has a less compact structure as
shown in 51.

7.2.1 Dynamical models
The data issued from neutron scattering measurements need to be interpreted in a frame of
physical models describing the different types of motions which compose the global status
of the sample. The easiest assumption which is usually made is to consider every type of
motion de-correlated with respect to the others and every atom dynamically equivalent to
the others. For this, the position of the atom i reads:
Ri = RCM + ri + ui (7.4)
where RCM is the position of the center of mass (CM) of the sample, ri is the atom position
with respect to CM and ui is the deviation from the equlibrium position RCM + ri. These
assumptions are reliable for small molecules with some degrees of symmetry but becomes
an approximation when applied to much more complex molecules like proteins. Assuming
that the latter is acceptable, i.e. that atom i represents the average dynamical properties of all
atoms in the sample, the intermediate scattering function can be recast as follows:
FH(q, t) = FCM(q, t) · Frot(q, t) · Fint(q, t) (7.5)
here the "rot" and "int" indexes refer to global rotational and internal motions, respectively.
Fourier transformation of 7.5 gives the relation for the dynamic structure factor which reads
now:
SH(q, t) = SCM(q, t)⊗ Srot(q, t)⊗ Sint(q, t) (7.6)
The term due to translation of the center of mass can be described following the Frick’s law of
diffusion of a free particle [13]. For the latter, particles positions are governed by a Gaussian
probability and thus, the intermediate scattering function F(q, t) will have a Gaussian form
as function of the momentum transfer [164]. The corresponding dynamic structure factor
S(q,ω) will have a Lorentzian form:
1 Dq2
S(q,ω) = (7.7)
π (Dq2)2 +ω2
7.2 efffects of pressure and temperature on if6s dynamics 135
where D is the diffusion constant and the half-width-half-maximum (HWHM) is defined by
Dq2. The contribution to equation 7.6 due to global rotational diffusion is more complicated
to obtain because it requires a description of molecules as rigid-bodies [37]. As stated in
Chapter 2, this term is not taken into account in our QENS measurements because it is largely
beyond the experimental resolution used here. Finally, several models have been developed
to analyze the internal motions of atoms in large molecules like proteins. This means that,
in the simplest case, all types of atomic diffusion motions which can be found into large
molecules, are averaged to find a unique dynamical property for all atoms that characterize
the molecule. This usually results in time-correlation functions characterized by a unique
relaxation time associated with all atoms in molecules.
However, a discussion all these models would be out of the scope of this thesis and accounts
can be found in many excellent reviews. Here a brief summary will be given of the model
used in this work to characterize atomic motions in proteins.
7.2.2 Fractional Brownian Dynamics
To interpret both the simulated and experimental data, the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
(OU) process [137] is used as an analytical model for the atomic motions in a protein. The
model describes anomalous diffusion in a harmonic potential, where the latter accounts for
the fact that atomic motions in a protein are confined in space. The anomalous diffusion
describes slow, non-exponential structural relaxation in the functional dynamics of proteins,
which has been observed in the past on the microsecond to second time scale by fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy[214] and by kinetic studies[64]. The existence of fractional Brownian
dynamics in proteins on the nanosecond time scale has been recently demonstrated by
analyses of molecular dynamics simulations [119] and the fractional OU process has been
introduced in [113] for the interpretation of QENS spectra from proteins. It can be considered
as an extension of a simple harmonic protein model, which has been used in the past to
describe elastic neutron scattering profiles, in particular to extract the “resilience” of proteins
in terms of an average force constant [216]. The fractional OU process (fOU) adds to this a
description of the relaxation dynamics, which is measured in QENS experiments.
Full details of fOU model and its application to protein dynamics can be found in previous
works [119, 113, 19, 20] and here I will recall only the key points needed for the following
136 results
analysis of MD and QENS data.
time-dependent mean-square displacement The most elementary quantity to
be considered in the context of diffusion processes is the time-dependent mean-square
displacement (tMSD),
W(t) := 〈[x(t) − x(0)]2〉, (7.8)
where x is the position of the diffusing particle and the brackets indicate a thermal average.
In case that the dynamics of the particle is confined in space, the tMSD will tend to a plateau
value, which is giv 2(en by 2〈x 〉. For t)he fractional OU process one has
W(t) = 2〈x2〉 1− E αα(−[t/τ] ) . (7.9)
Here Eα(z) is t∑he Mittag-Leffler function [52]∞ zk
Eα(z) = , (7.10)
Γ(1+αk)
k=0
where Γ(.) denotes the generalized factorial [2]. One recognizes that for α = 1, where Γ(1+
αk) = Γ(1+ k) = k!, the exponential function is retrieved from expression (7.10), i.e. E1(z) =
exp(z). In this case the fractional OU process becomes the well-known standard Markovian
OU process, which is characterized by exponential relaxation functions [205, 59, 164]. As
indicated in [117], the fractional counterpart is characterized by non-Markovian memory
effects, which lead to non-exponential correlation functions.
Expressions (7.10) and (7.9) show that the proposed model contains three parameters:
1. the position fluctuation 〈x2〉,
2. the parameter α indicating the deviation from exponential behavior,
3. the time scale parameter τ.
These parameters will be considered as q-dependent and will give account of the multiple
relaxation dynamics the characterize the internal motions on proteins.
relaxation rate spectrum The function E (−[t/τ]αα ) can be considered as a
“stretched” generalized exponential function. The non-exponential character of this func-
tion can be most easily visualized by writing it as a superposition of normal exponential
functions. Using ∫fo∞r simplicity a dimensionless time variable we have

modeling incoherent neutron scattering In the following the dynamic struc-
ture factor for incoh∫erent neutron scattering will be considered,
1 +∞
S(q,ω) = ∞ dt exp(−iωt)I(q, t), (7.14)2π −
where I(q, t) is the incoherent intermediate scattering function, which depends on the position
of the scattering atom
I(q, t) = 〈exp(iq[x− x0])〉. (7.15)
Here q = |q| is the modulus of the momentum transfer which the neutron transfers to the
scattering atom in the scattering process. Within the model it is assumed that the system
under consideration is isotropic and that, as made for EISFs, the protein dynamics, as seen
in incoherent neutron scattering, can be described by one “representative” atom. In this
case it suffices to consider one coordinate of the scattering atom, which is chosen to be the
x-coordinate. In view of the predominance of incoherent scattering by hydrogen atoms, the
representative atom in the model is a representative hydrogen atom.

fitting qens spectra The model introduced in previous paragraphs describes internal
protein dynamics and to be useful for the interpretation of QENS spectra of protein solutions
the effects of global diffusion and of finite instrumental resolution must be incorporated.
Neglecting multiple scattering effects and absorption, and assuming that global diffusion of
the IF6 molecules and internal motions are decoupled, one can write the measured dynamic
structure factor as convolution product (defining ∗ ∫+(f g)(ω) = ∞∞ dω ′ f(ω−ω ′)g(ω ′− )):
Sm(q, t) = (S ∗ l ∗ r)(ω), (7.20)
Here S stands for the dynamic structure factor of the model, l is a Lorentzian describing
translational diffusion (D is the diffusion constant),

7.2.3 Analysis of scattering functions obtained from MD simulations
The “natural” quantities for the analysis of MD simulations are time-dependent MSDs and
time correlation functions, such as the intermediate scattering functions (ISF), which can be
directly computed from the trajectories. In this thesis, the MD analysis package nMoldyn
7.2 efffects of pressure and temperature on if6s dynamics 139
was used for this purpose [166]. All global motions (translation and rotation) were filtered
out beforehand from all trajectories in order to avoid the presence of unwanted spurious
contributions in the calculation of correlation functions. The procedure used to accomplish
this task is well established and has already been explained in [115]. ISFs from aIF6 and eIF6
for four different values of momentum transfer are shown in Figures 53 and 54 for different
environmental conditions.
The related time-dependent tMSD is shown in Figure 52. Data were fitted with the fOU model
as explained in the previous section. Values for 〈x2〉 in 7.9 were fixed from direct calculation
on MD simulations. The results of fits together with calculation of atomic 〈x2〉 are reported
in Table 19.

Inspection by eye of tMSD plots reveals that eIF6 at 300K as well as aIF6 at 350K are quite
insensitive to pressure whereas they undergo a much more evident change at the non-natural
temperatures. Moreover, at high temperature eIF6 shows large variations due to pressure.
The fitted ISF from both samples are shown in Figures 53 and 54. Here, ISFs of both eIF6 and
aIF6 do not relatively change with respect to pressure when temperature is kept respectively
to 300K and 350K whereas significative variations occurred at different temperatures.
Again also the observations made on tMSD and ISF seem to confirm the presence of
corresponding states between the dynamical properties of the two IF6 homologues in their
natural conditions and defined by apparent similar responses to environmental changes.
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that here the presence of this correspondence is not found
through similar values of these quantities but by means of homologous variations in function
of thermodynamical variables. A further and more complete analysis of dynamical properties

can be obtained by means of fractional Brownian dynamics model. As explained in the
previous section, parameters α and τ given in the fOU model, define the heterogeneity of
relaxation dynamics and are valuable tools to characterize the internal motions in proteins.
Values of these two parameters obtained from fit with the fOU model of ISF are plotted as
a function of momentum transfer in Figures 55 and 56. Surprisingly, the fitted parameters
show several differences between aIF6 and eIF6:
- τ in eIF6 is generally larger than in aIF6 by a factor of 3, meaning that its internal
dynamics is characterized by slower motions. Moreover, its variation as function of
pressure is of opposite sign with respect to the one in the extremophile homologue.
- α in aIF6, although similar to the one obtained in eIF6, is always systematically larger
than the latter. Following the definition of α and expression 7.12 this could mean that
the two holomogues are characterized by different distributions of relaxation rates.
The partial discrepancies between the values of {α, τ} from tMSDs and those from ISFs
could be explained from the fact that tMSDs suffer much more than ISFs from the limited
time-length of MD trajectories which do not permit a good sampling to be achieved for
time-correlation functions.
A key point here is the understanding of which of differences found in {α, τ} are related
intrinsically to the differences between the two proteins and which can be taken as a possible

"signature" of adaptation. As will explained later in this chapter the sign of variations
with respect of temperature and pressure should be related to peculiar properties of each
homologue and more generally of each protein, whereas other qualities of these variations,
such as their length scale dependancy, could be related to evolutionary molecular adaptation.
The analysis of EISF was very useful for finding the corresponding states but it does
not show how dynamical properties of proteins are modified moving from unfavorable
conditions to physiological ones. The absolute value of parameter τ which characterizes
relaxation time as function of momentum-transfer, thus as function of length-scale, was
shown to be a useful tool to identify differences between eIF6 and aIF6. Interestingly,
comparing the value of τ of each protein in different environmental conditions to those
in natural conditions, one finds that in both samples, τ variations are q-dependent and
that their extension is related to the quality of extremeness of the particular environmental
condition. This comparison can be made normalizing values of τ to values at natural
conditions as shown in Figures 57 and 58. From these figures one can easily note that
variations in τ become non-uniform as external conditions move too far from the natural
(optimal) ones and they mainly involve the region corresponding to small momentum transfer.
7.3 comparison with qens measurements
In the QENS experiments performed for this thesis work a number of technical difficulties
were encountered which severely limited the amount and the quality of data. Hence, only
a purely qualitative comparison with MD was possible. The main problems related to
experimental measurements were due to the lack of previous knowledge of the chemical
properties of IF6 samples:
eIF6 turned out to have a very low stability in the experimental setups developed for this
work. Indeed, in high pressure experiments after some hours of measurements the
protein started to aggregate and very few spectra were reliable for analysis. Probably
this was due to variations in protein concentration caused by pressure application and
the coexistence of CTAIL and the poly-histidine tag which could interfere with protein
stability.
The evaluation of protein concentration in solution was made very difficult by the very
low quantity of chromophore aminoacids which resulted in low UV absoprtion. As

a consequence, the absorption at 280nm, usually measured to estimate the protein
concentration gave systematic errors greater than 10%.
In addition to these limitations, one should recall also the other results found on eIF6 stability
and reported in Chapter 3. For this reason, QENS spectra of eIF6 will not be shown here.
Some preliminary analysis of spectra from aIF6 was, however, still possible and will be used
here to support some of the observations made by means of MD simulations.
7.3.1 Ambient pressure measurements
Measurements at ambient pressure were performed on the spectrometer FOCUS (Paul
Scherrer Institut, Switzerland) as explained in the Chapter 3. Spectra for the empty sample
container, solvent and protein solutions were acquired. The experimental spectra were treated
as mentioned in Chapter 3. The following procedure was used to estimate the sample
container transmission in the presence of samples: i) firstly, the empty cell spectra were fitted
with a normalized Gauss(ian function):

G(ω;ω0,σ) = √ (7.26)

ii) secondly the Gaussian function with parameters {ω0,σ} fixed from the previous fit on
empty cell was used to estimate the contribution of the sample container in solvent spectra
which were fitted by the following expression:
Ssolvent(q,ω) = A (τ G(ω;ω0,σ) + (1− τ)SB(q,ω)) (7.27)
where A is a normalization factor and
∑2 1 Γ2
SB(q,ω) = i , (7.28)

The expression for SB(q,ω) is intended to describe global translation and rotation of
solvent molecules. In order to limit the systematic errors due to the technical constraints listed
above, the resulting spectra containing the contribution of the sample container, the solvent
and the protein itself, were fitted with the fractional Brownian Dynamics model following the
expression:
Smes(q,ω) = C(α ((1− τ ′) S˜ (q,ω) + τ ′S P S˜E(q,ω)) + (1−α) S˜B(q,ω; Γ1, Γ2)) (7.29)
where S˜P(q,ω) was defined by expression 7.23, S˜B(q,ω; Γ1, Γ2) was obtained from previous
fit and S˜E(q,ω)) is the spectrum from the empty sample container. Here, S˜ represents

Data were fitted in the range [−1.5 : 0.1]meV . The EISF obtained from this fit is shown
in Figure 60 together with the EISFs obtained from MD simulations. Experimental data
seem to agree very well with those obtained from MD simulation. The diffusion constant
estimated from 7.23 is given in Figure 61 as a function of momentum transfer. The values can
be compared with those given by direct calculation from the IF6 molecular dimensions. Here
it is worth noting that the spherical approximation for the usual Einstein-Stokes expression
of the translation diffusion constant would not fit very well in the case of IF6 as the protein
shape can be better approximated by a disk or by a torus. These corrections to the spherical
case can be performed by means of the Perrin factor and the explicit expression for torus
diffusion constant (Appendix B). The values obtained from aIF6 were calculated using the
volume associated to the solvent accessible surface and are given in Table 20. In the Perrin
factor approximation the dimensions of the disk-shape which describe the IF6 structure was
estimated by a orthorhombic box which included the whole molecular structure. Experimental
values have to be corrected with respect of the viscosity of D2O which is 20% higher than that

7.3.2 High pressure measurements
As mentioned in the chapter on experimental and simulated systems setups, all the QENS
measurements performed in the pressure cell system required large volumes of protein
solution. This was a limiting factor for the cleavage of the poly-histidine tag (HTag) used to
enhance the expression protocol yield. For this reason, high pressure measurements were
performed with aIF6 with HTag (aIF6-HTag). Also for these measurements the knowledge of
precise protein concentration in sample solution would be essential for the correct analysis of
spectra. As a consequence, a correct treatment for the analysis of quasi-elastic spectra was
not possible. Nonetheless, acquired spectra were used to estimate EISF from aIF6-Htag with
a qualitative approach which was however useful to partially support the observations made
by MD simulations.
Spectra from empty cell, solvent and protein solution were taken and the same procedure for
the estimation of sample container transmission used for ambient pressure measurements
was used here.
The empty cell contribution was subtracted from solvent and protein solution spectra with a
transmission τ = 0.90. EISF from aIF6-Htag was estimated directly from the protein solution
spectra from the expression:
Ssolution(q,ω) = B (β G(ω;ω0,σ) + (1−β)L(q,ω)) (7.30)
where L(q,ω) which accounts for IF6 global and internal motions as well as for solvent
quasi-elastic contribution and G(ω;ω0,σ) is a Gaussian function which should estimate the
EISF from aIF6-HTag. The normalized fitted EISFs at different temperatures and pressures
are shown in Figure 63. The MD simulation of aIF6-HTag was performed in order to compare
experimental data. After filtering out the global motions as the other MD simulations,
the scattering functions were calculated using the nMoldyn package. The EISFs from MD
simulation are plotted together with experimental ones in Figure 63. Experimental results
seem to underestimate EISF with respect to MD but the variation due to pressure and
temperature are qualitatively similar. Here, it is worth noting that in general MD simulations
tend to overestimate EISF due to the limited time length of trajectories which is far from being
sufficiently large to correctly evaluate this quantity. From the experimental point of view,
however, the EISF could be susceptible to systematic errors due to an incorrect subtraction
of the sample container. Indeed, the latter could give a different contribution from the one

7.4 discussion and conclusion
The effects of pressure and temperature on IF6s have been characterized here both from
structural and from a dynamical points of view. Each approach gave different insights
into the response of IF6s to environmental changes: i) global structural responses were
investigated by means of radius of gyration and SASA whereas local effects were studied
by RMSF analysis combined with ScrewFit profiles. The latter, besides giving significant
insights into the conformational changes induced by pressure and temperature, allowed
to assess secondary structure fluctuations induced by the same thermodynamic variables;
ii) dynamical responses were instead investigated by means of scattering functions which
allowed direct comparison between MD simulations and QENS experiments.
EISF
152 results
For the discussion of results shown in the previous sections, it is important to underline
the role of the definition of extreme conditions: in contrast to what it is commonly thought,
the conditions that request a significant re-adaptation of protein structures are not only
those which have unfavorable chemical and thermodynamical conditions in the general
sense. In fact, as already stated in the Introduction, some proteins seem to behave better at
their own natural conditions than in other environmental situations, even though the former
are, in principle, chemically and physically less favorable than the latter. This observation
is comforted by works on enzymes activity which seemed to maintain corresponding states
between different environmental conditions that requested evolutionary adaptation. These
states are usually characterized by similar conformational flexibility [92].
structure As a whole the effects of pressure and temperature on IF6 structures showed
that the anti-association factor 6 from Methanococcus Jannaschii (aIF6) is much less sensitive
than its mesophilic counterpart from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (eIF6) with respect to extreme
conditions, as shown by variation in solvent accessible surface and in atomic root mean
square fluctuations. In particular it was also found that its structural properties at high
temperature and high pressure were very similar to those of eIF6 at 300K-1bar. This response
is characterized by fluctuations of α-carbons in the protein backbone and by variations in
secondary structures.
Here, the presence of corresponding states was made evident from observations on structural
fluctuations and by the comparison of different EISFs which proved by its relation to the
mean square displacement that this process is linked to the change on spatial confinement of
protein internal motions. The same type of results were obtained by Tehei and coworkers
[191, 192] in the comparison of molecular dynamics in thermophilic and mesophilic proteins.
As a whole, these results suggest that corresponding states are created by local structural
re-arrangements that influences atomic motions in proteins. For this purpose, evolution plays
on sequence point mutations to give the right adjustment of intramolecular interactions and
thus obtain the desired effect on protein structure stability.
Comparison between the EISFs of eIF6 and aIF6 gave the evidence that MSDs are very
similar in the respective natural conditions. The comparison of these results with those
previously obtained on the EISF from lysozyme [20] at ambient pressure (Figure 64), shows a
7.4 discussion and conclusion 153
surprising correspondence suggesting the presence of a condition for optimal "resilience" of
protein structures.

Figure 64: Elastic Incoherent Structure Factor for aIF6, eIF6 and lysozyme.
In IF6’s protein family this condition seems to be achieved thanks to a tail of 21 amino
acids (CTAIL) attached to the C-terminus of the more evolutionarily conserved part of IF6,
because its presence was the source of the lower stability of eIF6 in extreme conditions,
whereas its absence made eIF6-NoCTAIL behave like aIF6. Moreover, the role of CTAIL is
made even more important by the fact that it induces large thermal fluctuations to structural
regions which are supposed to play a direct role in IF6 functions.
Interestingly, similar results have been obtained on EISFs from aIF6-HTag indicating that
even the presence of a fluctuating non-structured tail attached on the N-terminus of aIF6
could make the latter not suited for warm deep sea environments.
The application of the ScrewFit method to time-averaged structures allowed also some
local effects of pressure and temperature to be detected and characterized by comparison
with three-dimensional structures. The main outcome of this analysis revealed that pressure

and temperature have locally different effects on IF6 structures. Some of these effects were
enhanced by separate application of high pressure and high temperature, whereas they
disappeared when both conditions where applied simultaneously.
dynamics The investigation of the dynamical effects refined the structural results.
Scattering functions from the MD simulations of both aIF6 and eIF6 were analyzed by means
of fractional Brownian dynamics (fOU) model. The latter was proved in other works to be
able to finely characterize the multiple relaxation time dynamics of proteins.
The fOU model showed that aIF6 and eIF6 can be distinguished from each other by their
dynamical properties. In particular it was shown that they have different characteristic
q-dependent relaxation times and give different responses to pressure application. Indeed,
when pressure is applied one would expect that slower diffusive motions on large length
scales are slowed down since they require large scale spatial rearrangements which are
increasingly hindered under pressure. Parameter τ from fit of aIF6 seems to confirm this
behaviour whereas it does not for eIF6 in which it is lowered by pressure increase. This fact
could be explained by the possible denaturation of eIF6, which has already been observed in
real experiments and that could be visible already in the nanosecond time-scale.
This outcome suggests that fOU parameters are able to capture dynamical properties of
each protein, being able to pinpoint differences between two homologues of the same protein
family. Moreover, it seems evident that if corresponding states can be found from the atomic
MSD, the fOU model can chracterize how unfavorable environmental conditions differentiate
from the physiological one by means of the dynamical parameters.
Indeed, if variation of dynamical properties due to changes in pressure and temperature,
must be related to each protein characteristic, the general framework in which this variation
happens can somehow be a common property of protein families. In this context comparison
of relaxation times in different environmental conditions showed that the approaching
of a favorable environment corresponds to a non-uniform change in relaxation times.
In particular motions involving large domains are less influenced than more localized motions.
7.4 discussion and conclusion 155
The limited amount and quality of experimental data did not permit to completely verify
this hypothesis made by means of MD simulations. QENS experiments have shown however
consistency with MD results. In particular EISF and the translational diffusion constant found
by experiment at ambient pressure was found to be comparable with those estimated by MD
simulations. High pressure experiments were largely biased by technical problems and could
not give any quantitative result. Nevertheless, a qualitative comparison with MD simulation
was possible by estimating the EISF contribution from the protein solution spectra.

GENERAL CONCLUS IONS AND PERSPECT IVES
In the introduction was stated that this work was proposed to give an answer to the following
questions:
Where does the extremophilic signature come from ?
If structure cannot be the origin for this, can it be the dynamics??
The test case for this extremophilic signature searching was to be found in structural
and dynamical properties of the Inititation Factor 6 from Methanococcus Jannaschii, an
archaebacteria which lives in the warm deep sea, near the hydrothermal chemineys. This
protein was chosen for its important role into the synthesis of other proteins, through its
participation into the biogenesis of major ribosome subunits and the limitation of association
of the two subunits.
IF6 homologue from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was chosen as "normal" conterpart for a
detailed comparison. The approach used in this work, which combined MD simulations and
QENS experiments, presented several new aspects to both techniques that requested the
development of novel theoretical and experimental methods. Firstly, a new computational
method was needed to finely pinpoint even small changes in protein structures induced by
environmental changes. For this purpose, a method based on quaternion superposition fits
in conjunction with Chasles’ theorem on rigid body motions was developed. This method,
called ScrewFit, proved to be efficient in finding variations in secondary structure of proteins
and in characterizing them with respect to the deformations in protein structural motifs. The
method found also further developments in protein secondary structure assignments and in
finding the structural effects due to ligand binding in enzymes.
Secondly, the two IF6 homologues were entirely new samples for QENS experiments and
demanded new protocols for expression and purification in order to obtain adequate
sample concentration in final solutions. The developed protocol reported here had a
yield sufficient for neutron scattering measurements of protein solution. Nevertheless,
it also involved other technical complications due to the presence of a N-terminal poly-
histidine tag which was needed to improve the total yield of protein purification. The
157
158 general conclusions and perspectives
clavage of the supplemental histidine-tag in large volumes needed for high pressure mea-
surements is prohibitive due to its efficiency, the latter being inversely proportional to volume.
The major results of this work are related to the finding of "corresponding states" in
structure and dynamics of each homologue in its respective natural condition. These "states"
are characterized by very similar atomic mean square displacements, meaning that the
atomic internal motions in respective natural conditions are confined to the same length
scales. This type of correspondence was already found in other works on other proteins both
experimentally [192] and by MD simulations[69]. These results were formerly interpreted as
an indication of different "resiliences" of extremophile and mesophile proteins. In this work I
showed that even if corresponding states are found, they do not involve the same dynamical
behavior in extremophilic and mesophilic homologues. Nevertheless, the variation of charac-
teristic time as function of length-scale seems to be able to capture the optimality of conditions.
Throughout this thesis the dynamical characterization of IF6 samples modeled by MD
simulations was pursued using a fractional Brownian dynamics model which proved to
efficiently characterize the multi-time-scale heterogeneity in protein internal motions.
Besides the general discussion about "corresponding states", this work showed also that in
the case of IF6, pressure and temperature induce different local effects in protein structures.
Some of these effects seems to affect regions that probably host functionality of IF6s. The
structural analysis by means of Screwfit parameter profiles showed that pressure and temper-
ature effects are neither equivalent nor of opposite sign. They are qualitatively different. The
present knowledge of these effects does not permit the association of the latter to the global
effects inscribed into the formation of "corresponding states".
The experimental results which were very limited by the absence of adequate protocols and
previously unknown sample instability, could however support indirectly results obtained
from MD simulations.
perspectives This work proposed a new approach to the investigation of evolutionary
adaptation of proteins to extreme environments from both a structural and a dynamical
point of view. Nevertheless, its novelty had to face some experimental limitations. This
did not prevent experimental results being obtained which supported the MD simulations.
159
Nevertheless, the results shown here should be verified by MD simulations also for longer
time-scales in order to better explore dynamical properties of IF6s. In this context, some
neutron backscattering experiments, which access longer time-scales, have already been
performed during this thesis on the IN16 (Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble, France) and
HFBS (NIST, Gaithersbourg, USA) spectrometers.
As a whole, this work must be considered preliminary and requires further development
both in expression/purification protocols of samples and in technical instrumentation for
QENS experiments. In fact, the latter may become a limiting factor when performing mea-
surements on protein solutions which require stable samples even at very high concentrations.
This thesis suggested, however, that IF6 constitutes a very interesting sample for studies
on molecular evolution and it is worth being further investigated both by QENS and
other molecular spectroscopy techniques. In particular small angle scattering (X-ray and
neutrons) should be envisaged to obtain more insights into the structural effects of different
environmental conditions and the role of CTAIL in eIF6 stability.
In addition to its role in molecular evolution studies, IF6 dynamical properties could be
explored by neutron scattering also in relation to its recently uncovered role in regulating the
human tumor cell development[172].
Finally this work constitutes a new approach for investigating molecular evolution. Sim-
ilar approaches have been recently used to investigate the relation between other physical
properties of proteins and their evolutionary history[215].
