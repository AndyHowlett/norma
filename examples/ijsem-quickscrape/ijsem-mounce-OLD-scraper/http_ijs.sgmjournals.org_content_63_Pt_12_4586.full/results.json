The endophytic\n                     strain was isolated from Zn/Cd-accumulating Salix caprea in Arnoldstein, Austria. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene demonstrated that the novel strain is most closely related to members\n                     of the genus Spirosoma (95 % sequence similarity with Spirosoma linguale). The genomic DNA G+C content was 47.2 mol%. The predominant quinone was and the major cellular fatty acids were summed feature\n                     3 (iso-C15 : 0 2-OH and/or C16 : 1ω7c), C16 : 1ω5c, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH and iso-C15 : 0. On the basis of its phenotypic and genotypic properties, strain EX36T should be classified as a novel species of the genus Spirosoma, for which the name Spirosoma endophyticum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EX36T ( = DSM 26130T = LMG 27272T).\n                  \n                  \n               "
