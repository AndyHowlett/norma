      "\n                  \n                      Next Section\n                  Abstract\n                  \n                  Ten species of the order Myxococcales with validly published names are devoid of living type strains. Four species of the genus Chondromyces are represented by dead herbarium samples as the type material. For a species of the genus Melittangium and two species of the genus Polyangium, no physical type material was assigned at the time of validation of the names or later on. In accordance with rule 18f of\n                     the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria the following type strains are designated for these species: strain Cm\n                     a14T ( = DSM 14605T = JCM 12615T) as the type strain of Chondromyces apiculatus, strain Cm c5T ( = DSM 14714T = JCM 12616T) as the type strain of Chondromyces crocatus, strain Sy t2T ( = DSM 14631T = JCM 12617T) as the type strain of Chondromyces lanuginosus, strain Cm p51T ( = DSM 14607T = JCM 12618T) as the type strain of Chondromyces pediculatus, strain Me b8T ( = DSM 14713T = JCM 12633T) as the type strain of Melittangium boletus, strain Pl s12T ( = DSM 14670T = JCM 12637T) as the type strain of Polyangium sorediatum and strain Pl sm5T ( = DSM 14734T = JCM 12638T) as the type strain of Polyangium spumosum. Furthermore, the type strains given for three species of the genera Cystobacter and Polyangium had been kept at one university institute and have been lost according to our investigations. In accordance with Rule 18c\n                     of the Bacteriological Code, we propose the following neotype strains: strain Cb fe18 ( = DSM 14716  = JCM 12624) as the neotype\n                     strain of Cystobacter ferrugineus, strain Cb m2 ( = DSM 14751 = JCM 12627) as the neotype strain of Cystobacter minus and strain Pl fu5 ( = DSM 14668 = JCM 12636) as the neotype strain of Polyangium fumosum. The proposals of the strains are based on the descriptions and strain proposals given in the respective chapters of Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (2005).\n                  \n                  \n               "
