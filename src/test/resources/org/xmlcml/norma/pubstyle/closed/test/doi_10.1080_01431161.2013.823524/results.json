      "Sustainable practices require a long-term commitment to creating solutions to environmental, social, and economic issues. The most direct way to ensure that management practices achieve sustainability is to monitor the environment. Remote sensing technology has the potential to accelerate the engagement of communities and managers in the implementation and performance of best management practices. Over the last few decades, satellite technology has allowed measurements on a global scale over long time periods, and is now proving useful in coastal waters, estuaries, lakes, and reservoirs, which are relevant to water quality managers. Comprehensive water quality climate data records have the potential to provide rapid water quality assessments, thus providing new and enhanced decision analysis methodologies and improved temporal/spatial diagnostics. To best realize the full application potential of these emerging technologies an open and effective dialogue is needed between scientists, policy makers, environmental managers, and stakeholders at the federal, state, and local levels. Results from an internal US Environmental Protection Agency qualitative survey were used to determine perceptions regarding the use of satellite remote sensing for monitoring water quality. The goal of the survey was to begin understanding why management decisions do not typically rely on satellite-derived water quality products."
