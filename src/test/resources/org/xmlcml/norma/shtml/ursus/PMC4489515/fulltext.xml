In coastal Alaska, social river otters (<italic>Lontra Canadensis</italic>), largely males, cooperatively forage on schooling fish and use latrine sites to communicate group associations and dominance. Conversely, solitary otters, mainly females, feed on intertidal-demersal fish and display mutual avoidance via scent marking. This behavioral variability creates &#x0201c;hotspots&#x0201d; of nutrient deposition and affects plant productivity and diversity on the terrestrial landscape. Because the abundance of schooling pelagic fish is predicted to decline with climate change, we developed a spatially-explicit individual-based model (IBM) of otter behavior and tested six scenarios based on potential shifts to distribution patterns of schooling fish. Emergent patterns from the IBM closely mimicked observed otter behavior and landscape use in the absence of explicit rules of intraspecific attraction or repulsion. Model results were most sensitive to rules regarding spatial memory and activity state following an encounter with a fish school. With declining availability of schooling fish, the number of social groups and the time simulated otters spent in the company of conspecifics declined. Concurrently, model results suggested an elevation of defecation rate, a 25% increase in nitrogen transport to the terrestrial landscape, and significant changes to the spatial distribution of &#x0201c;hotspots&#x0201d; with declines in schooling fish availability. However, reductions in availability of schooling fish could lead to declines in otter density over time.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding for this project was provided by the National Science Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsf.gov/">http://www.nsf.gov/</ext-link>) DEB #0454474, the University of Georgia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://uga.edu">http://uga.edu</ext-link>) Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.warnell.uga.edu/">http://www.warnell.uga.edu/</ext-link>), and the University of Wyoming (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://uwyo.edu">http://uwyo.edu</ext-link>).

For example, using empirical data on abundance, survival and habitat selection of polar bears (<italic>Ursus maritimus</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], in conjunction with stochastic population models parameterized with sea ice loss based on global circulation models, Hunter et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] projected a 0.8&#x02013;0.94 probability of extinction of the Beaufort Sea population by the year 2100.</p><p>Evaluation of the effects of climate change on animal behavior is mostly limited to migration and breeding phenologies [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A notable exception is the study of gray wolves (<italic>Canis lupus</italic>) on Isle Royal, Michigan, where a relation between snow accumulation and social grouping was established. Hunting by larger wolf packs facilitated an increase in kill rates of moose (<italic>Alces alces</italic>). As a result, the moose population declined facilitating an increase in the growth of balsam fir (<italic>Abies balsamea</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The paucity of empirical and modeling studies on the potential effects of climate change on animal behavior and cascading ecosystem responses [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] is surprising. Because individuals are the building blocks of inherently complex ecological systems [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and provide a natural scale at which to measure biotic and abiotic interactions [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], this seems an appropriate level for climate change investigations. Individuals are limited behaviorally and physiologically and their responses may be more predictable and easier to model than that of a population [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, individuals respond to internal and external environments by seeking to maximize &#x02018;fitness&#x02019; through adaptive behavior, leading to the emergence of system level properties [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Individual-based simulation models (IBM), which treat individuals as unique and discrete entities, have been used since the 1970&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These discrete entities have several unique characteristics, such as age, that change during the cycle of the model [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. IBMs have several advantages over analytical and stochastic system models, including variability among individuals, local interactions, complete life cycles [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and responses to previous and current states (i.e. Markovian dependencies). Also, an emergent property of an IBM is the overall system stochasticity, precluding the need to combine the effects of multiple variance components associated with dynamic system models [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further, spatially explicit IBMs integrate individual responses with landscape heterogeneity by specifying the explicit location of entities and their spatial relationship to other landscape features [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These advantages allow testing of theory under many different conditions, an attribute typically not available in natural systems [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This attribute is especially desirable given the myriad of potential climate change scenarios.</p><p>Similar to seabirds [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], piscivory by coastal river otters (<italic>Lontra canadensis</italic>) provides a pathway for nutrient transport between sea and land [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Marine-derived carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) transported by river otters to terrestrial latrine sites (specific locations along the shoreline) can be several orders of magnitude higher than other nutrient inputs in this system [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Uptake of marine-derived nutrients (MDN) associated with river otter activity increases photosynthetic capacity of the overstory layer of coastal conifer forests [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Coastal river otters exhibit atypical social behavior compared with other mammals [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this system males occur in large groups (3&#x02013;18 otters) that increase foraging efficiency on schooling pelagic fish within the nearshore environment [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Group size depends on the availability and spatial distribution of these pelagic fish [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast, female otters and some males remain solitary year round, foraging primarily on intertidal-demersal fish. These individuals occasionally join a male group to opportunistically forage on pelagic fish, most likely because schooling pelagic fish have a higher energy density than the intertidal-demersal ones [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>In coastal Alaska, social otters frequently use specific latrine sites as communication centers, advertising group association and dominance [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In contrast, nonsocial otters visit numerous latrine sites at low frequency, likely facilitating mutual avoidance [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These behavioral differences among individuals are determined by otter demography (abundance and sex ratio) and the distribution of pelagic fish in the nearshore environment. Extant spatial and temporal variation in the availability of pelagic fish leads to shifts in otter-mediated nutrient flux from sea to land, potentially making this system highly sensitive to future climate change.</p><p>The nearshore environment of coastal Alaska supports a diverse fish community composed of two distinct groups: resident intertidal-demersal species and migratory pelagic species. The intertidal species, primarily <italic>Cottidae</italic>, <italic>Scorpaenidae</italic>, <italic>Hexagrammidae</italic>, <italic>Cancridae</italic>, together with invertebrates such as mussels (<italic>Mytilus trossulus</italic>) and crabs (<italic>Metacarcinus gracilis</italic>, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>magister</italic> and others), are a ubiquitous, non-migratory prey [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>Salmonidae</italic>, <italic>Ammodytidae</italic>, <italic>Clupeidae</italic>, and <italic>Gadidae</italic> arrive in the nearshore environment to spawn [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These schooling pelagic fish species typically begin spawning in early May and return to the open ocean or expire (salmon) by November [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The responses of intertidal species to future climate change are unknown [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Nonetheless, decadal surveys conducted in the Gulf of Alaska, as well as species specific studies, demonstrate that schooling pelagic fish, who are cold water specialists, disappear from shallow coastal areas accessible to river otters with increasing sea-surface temperatures [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, warming temperatures may result in decreases in availability of these fish, leading to shifts in otter sociality and nutrient transport to the terrestrial landscape.</p><p>Our goal was to investigate the effects of variation in the availability of schooling pelagic fish on nutrient transport by coastal river otters via a spatially explicit IBM.

[<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and Larsen [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Each metric was calculated for every 10m interval along the coastline (point-location). We employed Maximum Entropy [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] to estimate the probability (MEP) of each point-location used as an otter latrine [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. During each simulation, MEP was used as a surrogate for otter habitat quality.</p><p>To complete the construction of the landscape network, we appended an additional 80.3 km of &#x02018;virtual lines&#x02019; to the coastline network (<xref rid="pone.0126208.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) to act as travel corridors between islands and across large bays [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The virtual lines were constructed through a multiple step process. First, we created Thiessen polygons using the 10m point-locations and converted into lines. For approximately every 2 km of coastline, the line connecting two islands or a bay was retained and the excess removed. The remaining virtual lines were slightly modified to create a straight line with only two vertices. Network Analyst tools within ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA) were used to identify network nodes and populate the adjacency table describing the connectivity of network edges. Portions of the landscape network were initially attributed as either within or outside the study area. The study area comprised 58% of the total available coastline within the landscape network.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Simulations</title><p>We simulated six separate scenarios, based on abundance and spatial distribution of schooling pelagic fish, each replicated 100 times (<xref rid="pone.0126208.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

That is, once a female ventured beyond the edge, her next movement oriented toward the central location. Female core areas were exclusive because empirical studies have shown that females have low spatial overlap and distinct core areas of use [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Male movements along the network were unconstrained in that we allowed male movements to overlap female core areas, as well as areas occupied by other males [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>The model simulates individual otter movement and behavior through foraging on both intertidal-demersal and schooling pelagic fish. Both male and female movements followed a Biased Correlated Random Walk (BCRW). Correlated random walks (CRWs) are those successive movements that have correlated directions [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In contrast, successive movements characterized by a consistent directional bias are termed BRCW [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In our case, the bias was composed of directional movements toward the central location of the female&#x02019;s home range and the nearest latrine site within 1km of a successful encounter with a fish school for both sexes. Therefore, foraging behaviors were influenced by the presence of otter feces and/or fish schools. For example, an otter would continuously move along the landscape network within a search distance drawn from a distribution for each hour of activity, or until it reached within 50m of a fish school (<xref rid="pone.0126208.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). If an otter did not encounter a fish school in a given activity bout, it was assumed to have consumed intertidal-demersal fish. The model also accounts for post-absorbance resting and olfactory communication processes (<xref rid="pone.0126208.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). At each time step, the activity-state of each otter was assessed with simulated behaviors occurring only when otters were active (<xref rid="pone.0126208.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The direction of movement along the network was determined by the detection of feces within 1km of the current location, simulating olfactory communication among group members (<xref rid="pone.0126208.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0126208.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0126208.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Model diagram describing the steps and decisions each simulated otter follows for each hour of the simulated period.</title><p>Values within parentheses indicate model equations to determine individual otter choices (<xref rid="pone.0126208.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0126208.g002"/></fig><p>Each foraging event was followed by defecation behavior driven by the defecation-state, satiation-state and spatial location of the individual. For example, an otter had an increased probability of defecating at the nearest highest-quality latrine after a successful encounter with a fish school, simulating successful feeding, or after 8&#x02013;9 hours have elapsed in which the otter is assumed to have fed on intertidal-demersal resources (<xref rid="pone.0126208.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The maintenance of an individual current activity-state (active or inactive) was driven by the hours within the current activity-state and the satiation-state. For example, duration of resting at a static location (i.e., den) was a function of the time elapsed since entering the inactive-state and whether the otter successfully encountered a fish school in the preceding foraging bout (<xref rid="pone.0126208.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0126208.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

For most response variables, except for male 50% core home-range and the proportion of &#x0201c;hotspot&#x0201d; sites, model estimates were within observed empirical ranges. The advantages of developing this IBM are clearly evident from the emergence of otter sociality without an explicit imposition within the model. However, these advantages may be overshadowed by model complexity and enormity of the resulting dataset. Having developed this model, we were able to forecast the potential effects of climate alteration via changes in schooling fish availability and demonstrated a significant change in the transport of MDN to the terrestrial environment in both quantity and distribution. Nonetheless, because our model was restricted to a single season, some of the emergent properties, such as the surge in fecal deposition rate, are likely a short-term response. In this model we did not account for a potential decline in demersal-intertidal fish given increased predation by otters in the absence of schooling pelagic fish; nor did we account for the likely decline in otter density over time. To fully understand the dynamics of this system under differing climate scenarios, this model will need to be extended to include multiple years and account for otter population vital rates.</p><p>The IBM approach is grounded in the belief that adaptive behaviors of individuals emerge as patterns at the system level [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To facilitate the expansion of IBMs in ecological theory, Uchma&#x00144;ski and Grimm [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] proposed four criteria for a model to be considered an IBM: 1) the degree to which an individual&#x02019;s life cycle is reflected; 2) the dynamics of individual resource use are explicitly represented; 3) real or integer numbers are used to represent population size; and 4) the extent to which variability between same age individuals is considered. We believe that our IBM meets these criteria: 1) although individual annual life cycle is not explicitly addressed, each individual&#x02019;s daily activity is accounted for on an hourly basis. An individual uses stochastic rules, based on previous experience and states, to determine whether to forage or rest; 2) each individual may have the opportunity to locate and prey upon pelagic fish schools. Concurrently, pelagic fish schools are dynamically interacting with the physical environment instead of behaving in a static manner; 3) pelagic fish school densities are accounted for using real numbers and seasonal models. Otter density is estimated from a known distribution of the study area and; 4) each individual experiences both temporal and spatial variability throughout the modeling process. The variability may occur through spatial location (habitat quality), prey availability, and unique hourly experiences influencing decisions that affect current and future states. Thus, while we restricted this model to a single season and did not include otter vital rates in this simulation, it can be considered a special case of an IBM.</p><p>Our IBM produced separate social patterns for male and female otters in the absence of explicit rules of intraspecific attraction or repulsion. That is, foraging male otters were attracted to latrine sites containing fresh feces but not directly to each other, whereas females were attracted to the center of their core home ranges which did not overlap, indirectly creating repulsion. It appears that these simple rules are a self-organizing mechanism that generates sex-specific social groups in otters. Simulations of flocking and schooling behaviors in multiple species have been generated with relatively few rules of engagement, and groups were maintained without obvious fitness benefits [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Nonetheless, in such models the self-organizing rules include specific code for intraspecific synchronization and cohesion [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In contrast, in our modeled otter sociality and grouping behaviors emerged from foraging behavior loosely constrained by prey distribution on the landscape, suggesting that in some systems the formation of groups may be a by-product of resource distribution [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Nonetheless, while the number of simulated otter-groups and the time males and females spent in social groups declined with the reduction in schooling fish availability, sociality did not completely disappear with this resource. This agrees with observations of group formation in otters inhabiting freshwater systems. For example, Melquist and Hornocker [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] observed small groups of otters in Idaho and Serfass [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] recorded cooperative foraging in Canada. Thus it seems that in our model, as well as natural systems, other factors related to otter activity and landscape use foster aggregations.</p><p>To evaluate if other factors contribute to otter sociality, it will be imperative to assess whether simulated otters exhibited fidelity to certain groups. Although groups of wild river otters are formed at random with respect to kin [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], individuals exhibit high fidelity to their group [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Blundell et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] observed that during the mating season (which ends prior to the initialization of our model in May) several adult males dispersed to adjacent areas, but returned to their home range and re-joined the group they previously left approximately a month later. Similarly, male otters that exhibited high levels of dyadic interactions while in captivity were found in close spatial proximity post-release [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Hansen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] hypothesized that familiarity was the process influencing group cohesion in wild otters and suggested that male otter pups may become familiar with neighboring male groups via olfaction when visiting latrine sites with their dames. If so, we would expect otters to produce individually distinct olfactory signals that are recognizable by others [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Rostain et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] demonstrated that river otters are able to distinguish male and female feces as well as recognize the social status of animals relative to their own. These observations suggest that river otters excrete individualistic scent and are able to recognize the scent of others. Kean et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] have shown that the feces of Eurasian otters (<italic>Lutra lutra</italic>) contain compounds unique to adults and juveniles as well as sex-specific ones. It is reasonable to assume that river otter feces contain similar compounds and that both species also have individually-unique scent.</p><p>Despite the high fidelity, river otter groups in the wild exhibit numerous fission-fusion events while foraging [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] and the structure of the social network varies through time [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In the future we will use results from our model to assess group fidelity, structure of the social network, and frequency of fission-fusion events of simulated otters and compare them to empirical data derived from radiotelemetry, non-invasive genetic analyses, and Encounternet proximity sampling [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Should we find that simulated otters show little group fidelity, we will develop an additional decision rule for the model creating attraction to familiar individuals based on individualistic scent. Such a rule may correct the discrepancy between observed and modeled male home range size.</p><p>Inherent to our modeling rules was the assumption that consumption of schooling pelagic fish confers fitness benefits, although no immediate advantage was observed among wild otters. Based on the observation that the number of offspring and relatives in the population did not differ between social and solitary animals, and otters adopting either strategy have similar size and condition, Blundell et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] concluded that sociality did not produce fitness benefits. These authors hypothesized that the two social strategies (social and solitary), within the same population, persist because of large temporal fluctuations in the availability of schooling pelagic fish [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Testing of this hypothesis with empirical data will be impossible because the simultaneous collection of fish and otter data over an extended period of time will be impractical and inordinately expensive. Our results suggest that indeed when the availability of schooling pelagic fish declines, male otters forage and use latrines in a fashion resembling the behavior of females. Thus, once extended to include multiple years and account for otter population dynamics, our model could be used to test this and associated hypotheses.</p><p>Nonetheless, our model will require several adjustments before it can be extended. First, if simulated otters do exhibit high group fidelity, we will likely need to add a constraint on male movement to correct for the larger than observed male home ranges. Indeed, it is possible that our olfactory decision rule for male otters may have not been correctly formulated. The assumption that all feces are the same may need to be revisited because feces containing no pelagic fish may indicate resource depletion instead of resource availability [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Indeed, this may somewhat explain the drastic increases in male otter home-range sizes with decreasing availability of schooling pelagic fish.</p><p>Second, the model will require simplification because each single-season simulation took approximately 15 hours to complete. Our sensitivity analyses demonstrated that variation in Scent Decay Rate, Hours Active, and Visual (m) had relatively little influence on model outcomes, so these variables could potentially be made constant. It may also be possible to reduce the effect of the variable Memory (m), which forced the otters to travel to and potentially defecate at the nearest high-quality latrine within 1 km, rather than use any available latrine in their immediate vicinity. We created this decision rule because our field studies have shown that otters exhibit high fidelity to specific latrines, which are visited by multiple generations of otters [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Spatial memory has been documented from sharks to primates [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] and inclusion of such a parameter in models of animal movements has improved their accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. From this perspective it is not surprising that this parameter had such strong influence on our results, although we may still capture the effects of memory by allowing otters to travel to the nearest latrine.</p><p>Indeed, this latrine selection rule probably caused the emergence of lower number of &#x0201c;hotspot&#x0201d; sites with 50&#x02013;150 feces on the landscape as compared with our observed data. These emergent spatial properties of latrines were likely affected by the otter movement rule rather than the spatial placement of fish schools because the mean feces/day and the proportion of &#x0201c;hotspot&#x0201d; sites was similar between the Random_100% and the Schools_100% models. Only the actual location of used latrines was different between these two scenarios likely because foraging success increased when fish school locations were not restricted to specific spawning areas. Specifically, females experienced significantly higher success in locating fish schools than when these prey were patchily distributed. Because females were driven by different decision rules with regards to use of landscape, the distribution of latrines differed in this scenario.</p><p>Two processes may have influenced the lower fecal deposition rate we recorded in the Schools_100% and Schools_75% scenarios relative to values we observed in 2006 and 2007. First, we likely generated population estimates that were slightly biased low. We imposed a strong repulsion rule on females, basically that no two female core areas overlap. A relaxation of the rule may yield a slightly larger otter population. Also, we used the number of resident animals identified from non-invasive genetic sampling in 2006 within the study area [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and then divided that value by proportion of modeled landscape that composed of the study area. The number of residents included adult animals only, whereas the wild population was augmented in July with pups emerging from natal dens [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Including recruitment in the model would have likely increased the overall population size and fecal deposition rate. In fact, the spatially-explicit simulated otter population could serve as an excellent source of information for designing fecal collection protocols that will yield unbiased estimates for the wild population. Because the location of each river otter during every hour of the simulation is known, and the location and timing of its fecal excretion is also recorded and saved, we could simulate any number of collection scenarios, and using mark-recapture modeling [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], test which protocol (in terms of number of collection days and number of latrines sampled) provides the least biased and most accurate abundance estimate.</p><p>Second, the higher than expected fecal deposition rate in 2006 and 2007 may have resulted from the fact that we simulated fish school availability with data collected in 1996&#x02013;1999 [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], whereas we conducted the fecal deposition study nearly a decade later. Our observed fecal deposition rate suggests that in 2006 otters may have encountered a higher frequency of pelagic fish schools than in 2007. The mean sea-surface temperature in Prince William Sound was significantly different in June 2006 than in June 2007 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/</ext-link>), likely increasing the availability of schooling fish for otter consumption during 2006 and decreasing their fecal deposition rate. Following this rational it is reasonable to assume that schooling fish abundance in our study area was higher in the 1990s than in the 2000s. A recent stock assessment for Pacific herring illustrated poor recovery of this fishery in coastal Alaska with oceanographic factors as one of three main contributors [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that schooling fish availability was lower than modeled when we collected the empirical data. This hypothesis can be tested by conducting dietary analysis on the feces we collected to generate the abundance estimates in 2006 and calculating the percent containing pelagic fish.</p><p>With a decline in schooling pelagic fish, otters may exhibit a two-pronged response. They will likely switch to more heavily prey on intertidal-demersal fish and decline in abundance. In our model we did not account for the density and distribution of intertidal-demersal fish explicitly, and assumed that benthic resources are uniformly distributed. Instead, the marine abiotic conditions that usually affect benthic fish in this system were included as variables within the model predicting latrine quality (MEP) [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Dean et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] found differences in the distribution and abundance of benthic fish given characteristics of the marine environment. It may be an enlightening exercise to develop a model using only terrestrial variables for the otter latrine selection model and couple it with an intertidal-demersal fish habitat model. Such a model will allow us to assess the impact of varying benthic fish availability on otter behavior.</p><p>Our single-season model simulating the potential effects of climate change on nutrient transports from sea to land via the abundance of schooling pelagic fish and otter behavior resulted in several unexpected patterns. Foremost was the observation of elevated defecation rate and 25% increase in nitrogen transport to the terrestrial landscape. This occurred due to an increase in duration of the Active-State which reflected search of alternative prey and increased likelihood of visiting a latrine. This is clearly demonstrated within the sensitivity analysis in which Hours Inactive and Hours Between Defecation parameters had significant effects on mean feces/day. Also unexpected was the lack of decline in number of &#x0201c;hotspot&#x0201d; sites. While male group membership declined and their activity increased, their behavior in terms of attraction to latrines did not. A concurrent increase in nutrient deposition and the number of &#x0201c;hotspot&#x0201d; sites would have had significant implications to the vegetation at river otter latrines. Roe et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] documented increased productivity of conifers growing at river otter latrines compared with those growing on non-latrine sites. Concurrently, enhanced river otter activity caused a reduction in shrub biomass and allocation of excess nitrogen to storage in shoots [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The shading from densely foliaged conifers also resulted in declines in understory plant diversity on latrines [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Thus enhanced latrine visitation and increased nitrogen fertilization could influence the terrestrial landscape in this system. Nonetheless, in response to reduced availability of schooling fish, male otters are likely to change their behavior. Reduction in schooling fish availability will likely result in increased predation on intertidal-demersal fish which occur at lower biomass [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and have lower energy density than schooling pelagic fish [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Reduced resource availability will likely lead to declines in otter density over time. Indeed, otter density is substantially lower in ecosystems where food availability is diminished [<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126208.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Thus, changes to terrestrial vegetation will be short lived. In future models we will assess the effects of climate change on nutrient transports in this system, by extending this model to include multiple years and account for otter population dynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126208.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Tab-delimited text file containing summarized observations of individual otter behavior over a 24-hour period.</title><p>Column descriptions are as follows: IDNum (radio collar ID); MinOfStartTime (date/time describing the beginning time of the behavior); MaxOfStartTime (date/time describing the ending time of the behavior); DateGroup (integer identifying the unique set of observations for the individual otter); ActivityGroup (text identifying whether the otter was &#x02018;Active&#x02019; or &#x02018;Inactive&#x02019;); SumHr (float summarizing the total number of hours in the current state for the individual otter); TotTime (float the total number of hours of observation).</p><p>(TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126208.s001.txt"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126208.s002"><label>S2 Dataset</label><caption><title>Tab-delimited text file containing summarized observations of individual otter movement rates in meters per hour.</title><p>Column descriptions are as follows: Freq_StopID (text ID describing the individual collar ID and the observation ID in a &#x02018;from-to&#x02019; format); Activities (text describing the specific otter behaviors at the &#x02018;from-to&#x02019; locations.
