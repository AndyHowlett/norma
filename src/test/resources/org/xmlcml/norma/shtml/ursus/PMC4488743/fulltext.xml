Here, we apply to ancient DNA extracts the probe-independent Methylated Binding Domains (MBD)-based enrichment method, which targets DNA molecules containing methylated CpGs. Using remains of a Palaeo-Eskimo Saqqaq individual, woolly mammoths, polar bears and two equine species, we confirm that DNA methylation survives in a variety of tissues, environmental contexts and over a large temporal range (4,000 to over 45,000 years before present). MBD enrichment, however, appears principally biased towards the recovery of CpG-rich and long DNA templates and is limited by the fast <italic>post-mortem</italic> cytosine deamination rates of methylated epialleles. This method, thus, appears only appropriate for the analysis of ancient methylomes from very well preserved samples, where both DNA fragmentation and deamination have been limited. This work represents an essential step toward the characterization of ancient methylation signatures, which will help understanding the role of epigenetic changes in past environmental and cultural transitions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The retrieval of DNA from archaeological and palaeontological material provides direct genetic information about the evolutionary past<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. However, DNA fragmentation and chemical damage start shortly after an organism dies, making ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses particularly challenging. Many technologies have been developed to improve the characterization of aDNA since the early days of bacterial cloning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, which, together with the development of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies, opened access to an increasing number of ancient genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The extraordinary throughput of HTS technologies is, however, often hampered by the abundance of environmental microbial DNA in aDNA extracts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and shotgun sequencing can only achieve high-coverage genomes from exceptionally well-preserved material where microbial colonization is minimal (e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Several target enrichment methods have been developed to circumvent these limitations. Most are based on the hybridization of probes tiled on markers of interest to DNA library templates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Within a single enrichment experiment, the number of <italic>loci</italic> targeted can vary from the mitochondrial genome and a few nuclear genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> to entire bacterial genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, human chromosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> or complete mammalian genomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Hybridization-based target enrichment approaches are subject to a variety of experimental biases, including the possible over-representation of long inserts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, %GC-rich genomic regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and repetitive elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Additionally, as ancient DNA library inserts are generally short, the size of adapters can influence the enrichment efficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The number of mismatches between probes and library molecules, which increases with the evolutionary distance and the amount of <italic>post-mortem</italic> DNA damage, can also reduce annealing efficiency, which can represent a problem in situations where no closely related species are available for designing probes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p><p>Probe-free enrichment methods have been developed to avoid introducing bias while annealing probes to targets. With the &#x02018;uracil selection&#x02019; method, ancient DNA templates carrying damage (in the form of deaminated cytosines) can be separated from those showing no damage during library preparation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Deep sequencing of the damage-enriched fraction has shown enrichment of 1.1&#x02013;4.7-fold on a range of Neanderthal specimens, and performance is expected to increase with damage levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>Methyl Binding Domains (MBD) based enrichment is another probe-free enrichment method but directly operates on DNA extracts, prior to library construction. It exploits the affinity of MBD for methylated CpG dinucleotides (<sup>m</sup>CpG) so as to separate complex metagenomic assemblages into two fractions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, the first of which binds to MBD and is mostly of vertebrate origin, while the second does not bind and is mostly microbial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. This is so because vertebrate genomes are globally methylated, with 70&#x02013;80% of methylated cytosines being located in a CpG context in the human genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, in contrast to bacterial genomes where methylation marks are often found in non-CpG contexts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. This method could provide the basis for new enrichment approach in aDNA research, where microbial DNA often represents the vast majority of the DNA templates extracted. Surprisingly, it has so far been used in only a single aDNA study, which focused on the analysis of 200&#x02013;2,800 year-old barley seeds from a single archaeological site in southern Egypt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The potential of the method, thus, still remains largely unexplored.</p><p>Here, we applied MBD enrichment to a selection of mammalian fossil specimens preserved across a wide geographical and temporal range. We identify experimental conditions that influence the overall efficiency of MBD enrichment and conclude that the method is only compatible with a cost-effective characterization of ancient methylomes when DNA fragmentation and deamination are limited.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The MBD enrichment procedure tested in this study relies on the affinity of MBD2&#x02212;Fc for <sup>m</sup>CpGs. The MBD2&#x02212;Fc protein corresponds to the fusion of the human MBD2 domain and the Fc tail fragment of human IgG1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Following incubation, <sup>m</sup>CpG-rich DNA molecules bound to MDB2&#x02212;Fc can be recovered using paramagnetic beads coated with the protein A, which bind to the Fc tail. The supernatant (MBD&#x02212;) is expected to contain mostly DNA molecules showing low <sup>m</sup>CpG content in contrast to the enriched fraction (MBD+). We explored the performance of this MBD enrichment system using 20 aDNA extracts from soft and calcified tissues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), including specimens preserved in a variety of environments: seven from arctic regions (the Palaeo-Eskimo Saqqaq individual from Greenland that was previously genome sequenced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, two Siberian woolly mammoths, three polar bears, and one and three equids from Canada and Russia, respectively), and four equids from a cave, karstic formations and a submerged terrestrial site. These specimens spanned a wide temporal range, extending from the Holocene (~4,000 years before present, BP) to the Late Pleistocene (&#x0003e;45,000 years BP). Following MBD enrichment, both MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions were used to construct DNA libraries and were deep-sequenced to generate a total of 409 million paired-end sequences on Illumina HiSeq 2500 and MiSeq platforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3.7</xref>).</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Endogenous contents</title><p>Since <italic>post-mortem</italic> deamination progressively transforms <sup>m</sup>CpGs into TpGs, we first evaluated whether sufficient amounts of <sup>m</sup>CpGs were preserved to enable successful MBD enrichment. We were able to build Illumina DNA libraries from both the MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions for all samples investigated. After Illumina sequencing, we used stringent alignment parameters and quantified the proportion of molecules of endogenous origin based on the number of both low and high-quality hits (hereafter referred to as MQ0 and MQ25 filters) that mapped uniquely to the reference genomes (for extinct species, genomes of phylogenetically-close species). The MQ0 filter allowed us to quantify the fraction of the sequences that aligned against repetitive elements while the MQ25 filter identified high-quality unique hits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. For almost all comparisons (90%), the proportion of unique endogenous reads in the MBD+ fraction was lower than that in the MBD&#x02212; fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This represented only a 1.2&#x02013;1.3-fold reduction for the three polar bear specimens, but the reduction reached about two orders of magnitude in some of the equine and mammoth specimens (90&#x02013;138-fold for MQ0 and MQ25 filters, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2.1</xref>). The reduction of the proportion of endogenous reads could be partly explained by an increase in the proportion of PCR duplicates in MBD+ libraries (relative to MBD&#x02212; libraries), which was somewhat comparable to the reduction observed in endogenous contents (6 to 391-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2.2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>MBD enrichment efficiency</title><p>In contrast to the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome is globally hypo-methylated, if at all<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. We exploited this to evaluate the efficiency of MBD enrichment. To avoid biasing our estimates, only specimens where both MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions had a sufficient number of mitochondrial unique hits were considered (MQ25, and &#x02265;20 hits). As expected, the contribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the pool of endogenous sequences was found to decrease significantly in the MBD+ fractions relative to the MBD&#x02212; fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2.3</xref>). This was observed across all tissues, but most dramatically for one polar bear bone (PB25) and two mammoth tissues (heart - MZh_1, muscle - Mzm_1), which showed a 15.6-fold to 23.6-fold reduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2.3</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, using CpG island (CGI) annotations available for the human and horse reference genomes, we found that, in the MBD+ fraction, CGIs were on average 9.3-fold less covered than the rest of the genome (MQ25 filter; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3.1</xref>). This is in line with the overall hypo-methylation state of CGIs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>Since methylation is involved in the silencing of transposable elements (TEs), we also tested for differences in the representation of TEs between MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions. We found that sub-optimal hits (i.e., mapping to multiple genomic regions identified using the MQ0 filter) represented a larger proportion of endogenous reads in the MBD+ fraction than in the MBD&#x02212; fraction (average&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.4-fold increase, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3.2</xref>). To confirm that this was driven by TEs, which are present in multiple copies within the genome, we stratified coverage differences for annotated TEs in MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions. We found a higher abundance of TEs in the MBD+ fraction, which were on average 2.1-fold more abundant than in the MBD&#x02212; fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3.3</xref>).</p><p>To further assess the efficiency of MBD enrichment, we took advantage of the work by Pedersen and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, which quantified genome-wide methylation levels for the Palaeo-Eskimo Saqqaq individual. We used the sequence data presented by Rasmussen and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> and the regional methylation proxy (Ms) defined by Pedersen and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> to estimate methylation levels within 100&#x02009;bp sliding windows. We then performed MBD enrichment on DNA extracts from the Palaeo-Eskimo Saqqaq individual and tested whether the MBD+ fraction covered genomic regions with higher Ms values than the MBD&#x02212; fraction. MBD+ sequences were found to overlap regions with higher Ms values than MBD&#x02212; sequences for the two minimal coverage thresholds considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3.5</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, the under-representation of mtDNA and CGIs in the MBD+ fraction, coupled with the over-representation of TEs in the MBD+ fraction, and the presence of DNA fragments showing higher methylation rates in the Palaeo-Eskimo Saqqaq sequence data, demonstrate the overall efficiency of MBD enrichment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Size and base compositional bias</title><p>We next evaluated whether endogenous DNA fragments recovered in MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions exhibited similar molecular properties. Only samples showing at least 2,000 high-quality hits mapping uniquely against their respective reference genome (MQ25 filter) were considered so as to enable reliable estimates of base compositional bias. We implemented linear mixed models analyses to assess statistical differences within the two fractions for %GC content, CpG densities and the size of library inserts. We found that MBD+ fractions were significantly enriched in endogenous reads carrying higher %GC contents and CpG densities, with the exception of a single sample (MZh_1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S4.1 and S4.2</xref>).</p><p>In MDB+ fractions, CpG densities increased up to 3.1-fold compared to that observed for other dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S5.1 and S5.2</xref>). Interestingly, we detected a decrease in the number of ApAs, ApTs, TpAs and TpTs in the MBD+ fraction, coupled with an increase in the number of CpCs, GpCs and GpGs. These differences were statistically significant when tested for the three species with a minimum number of three individuals (except for CpG and GpC in polar bears; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S5.2</xref>). We also found that endogenous DNA inserts from MBD+ fractions were, on average, longer than in MBD&#x02212; fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This difference was statistically significant in the woolly mammoth (with the exception of MZh_1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4.2</xref>), where MBD+ DNA inserts were on average ~21-bp longer than those from the MBD&#x02212; fraction. MBD+ DNA library inserts were on average ~35-bp longer than those present in the MBD&#x02212; fraction amongst equids and ~56-bp longer amongst polar bears. These differences were statistically significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S4.1 and S4.2</xref>).</p><p>We observed that the relative amount of endogenous inserts showing at least one CpG generally increased with the size of DNA inserts. This trend was only apparent in MBD+ fractions, however, and the inverse was found in MBD&#x02212; fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>), suggesting that MBD enrichment separated methylated and unmethylated fractions more efficiently on long DNA templates. This most likely reflects enhanced DNA binding to MBD2&#x02212;Fc with increasing numbers of <sup>m</sup>CpG targets, as has been previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>The bias observed toward DNA templates that are longer and richer in <sup>m</sup>CpG is expected to contribute to the reduced molecular complexity of MBD+ fractions as the vast majority of endogenous DNA templates present in aDNA extracts consists of short DNA molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. To test this, we calculated the number of PCR duplicates found in the MBD+ fractions (relative to the MBD&#x02212; fractions, MQ25 filter; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2.2</xref>), which provides a measure of the loss of molecular complexity in the MBD+ fraction. We observed an inverse relationship with the median size of MBD+ endogenous inserts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). No relationship was found with other DNA damage related parameters (data not shown), confirming that the level of DNA fragmentation is a fundamental limitation in respect to the efficiency of MBD enrichment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNA damage</title><p>Given that <italic>post-mortem</italic> cytosine deamination transforms methylated CpGs into TpGs and that the efficiency of MBD2&#x02212;Fc binding increases for <sup>m</sup>CpG-rich DNA templates, we next evaluated whether MBD enrichment was biased against recovering fragments altered by <italic>post-mortem</italic> cytosine deamination, as described by Smith and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. We used mapDamage 2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> to quantify a series of <italic>post-mortem</italic> DNA damage parameters for each DNA library, including cytosine deamination rates at overhangs (&#x003b4;<sub>s</sub>) and in double-stranded (&#x003b4;<sub>d</sub>) DNA contexts, and a proxy for the average length of overhanging ends (&#x003bb;). We applied a threshold of 2,000 high-quality hits (MQ25 filter) as described above to the estimation of damage parameters.</p><p>Although not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S4.3, S4.4 and S4.5</xref>), we found that both &#x003b4;<sub>s</sub> and &#x003b4;<sub>d</sub> rates were generally lower in the MBD+ fraction than in the MBD&#x02212; fraction of a given specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). On average, we found a 1.8-fold reduction in the &#x003b4;<sub>d</sub> rates of MBD+ fractions (relative to MBD&#x02212; fractions). This reduction was of lower magnitude for &#x003b4;<sub>s</sub> rates (1.2-fold). This probably reflects that <sup>m</sup>CpGs present in overhangs of aDNA templates have a limited contribution to DNA binding to MBD2&#x02212;Fc, probably owing to their limited size (estimated here to be 0.9&#x02013;2.8&#x02009;bp-long on average; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).

MBD+ distributions were shifted towards higher coverage when compared to MBD&#x02212; distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).

This confirms that MBD enrichment does not significantly bias microbial profiles towards a particular bacterial group, as previously shown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The equine specimens, however, except for sample EQB, stand as an exception. In these samples, class-level profiles showed differences between the MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>), and Linear Discriminant Analyses (LDA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> identified significant enrichment for <italic>Afipia</italic>, <italic>Rhodopseudomonas</italic>, unclassified <italic>Methylocystaceae</italic> and <italic>Acetobacteraceae</italic> in MBD&#x02212; fractions, and for <italic>Burkholderia</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> in MBD+ fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>).

In this study, we explore the efficiency and potential biases that may result from MBD enrichment of aDNA extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Not unexpectedly, the method appears to be principally biased towards recovering CpG-rich templates. As a result, long molecules, which show a higher density of CpGs, and therefore higher binding potential to MBD2&#x02212;Fc, are preferentially enriched. The specificity of the method toward <sup>m</sup>CpGs is also apparent in the Palaeo-Eskimo Saqqaq sequence data, where the MBD+ fraction shows higher regional methylation scores than the MBD&#x02212; fraction, in the lower coverage of mtDNA and CGI, and in the over-representation of TEs in MBD+ fractions. In addition, DNA templates for which fewer cytosines have been deaminated (and therefore for which fewer <sup>m</sup>CpGs were converted to TpGs, which represent inappropriate targets for MBD enrichment), are over-represented in enriched fractions.</p><p>These features have several important consequences for the analysis of aDNA extracts. First, aDNA molecules are extensively fragmented after an organism dies. Real-time PCR experiments have shown a 10 to 100-fold decrease in the number of amplifiable templates for every doubling of the amplicon sizes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. NGS data from a range of environmental conditions have confirmed that endogenous aDNA molecules become exponentially rare with increasing fragment length. Although nucleosomes can sometimes protect DNA from fragmentation and introduce periodicity patterns in depth-of-coverage and size distributions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, DNA inserts rarely exceed 100&#x02009;bp. The observed bias towards recovering long DNA fragments, thus, unavoidably results in a decrease in the total number of molecules that are available for sequencing in the MBD+ fractions post-enrichment, which translates into reduced molecular complexity (and increased clonality) of DNA libraries. This bias is enhanced due to the faster cytosine deamination rates observed for methylated epialleles, since the relatively few number of methylated sites present in short templates will be relatively rapidly converted into inappropriate TpG targets. Additionally, from the billions of nucleotides that comprise mammalian genomes, only ~30&#x02009;million CpGs are found<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, of which only a subset are methylated in a tissue-specific manner. This means that the pool of endogenous molecules available for MBD enrichment shows lower complexity than the overall genome. We also found that microbial and organellar DNA templates represent an important proportion within MBD+ fractions and with the experimental conditions presented here, the population of endogenous sequences that lack CpGs but are still present in MBD+ fractions represents 1.0&#x02013;3.2% of the data for polar bears, 2.9&#x02013;30.9% for equids, 13.4&#x02013;48.8% for woolly mammoths and 46.28% for the Palaeo-Eskimo Saqqaq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables S3.4</xref>). Altogether, the relatively limited efficiency and drop in complexity associated with MBD enrichment as well as the substantial off-target carry-over observed suggest that MBD enrichment is probably not adequate for analyzing the vast majority of aDNA extracts, which generally show extensive DNA fragmentation, deamination, and microbial contamination.</p><p>However, despite the biases described above, MBD enrichment provided access to a fraction of the methylome from a diversity of remains originating from both permafrost and non-permafrost environments. This demonstrates that a significant proportion of <sup>m</sup>CpGs are still intact in a variety of aDNA extracts. Importantly, for the three polar bear samples, the total fraction of the genome that is covered after sequencing MBD+ fractions, as calculated from the cumulative length of unique high-quality hits observed for every million sequences generated, was found to be, on average, higher in MBD+ than in MBD&#x02212; fractions (0.041-fold <italic>vs.</italic> 0.027-fold; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2.4</xref>). It follows that for these samples, the reduction in complexity and endogenous content of DNA libraries constructed from MBD+ fractions is compensated for by an increase in the DNA library insert size. Common to these samples is a high endogenous content (23.3&#x02013;46.7%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2.1</xref>) and relatively moderate fragmentation levels (endogenous DNA fragments in MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions are on average 62.3 and 100.0&#x02009;bp long, which is 48.1&#x02013;99.4&#x02009;bp longer than that of the Palaeo-Eskimo Saqqaq; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4.1</xref>).</p><p>We therefore suggest that for similar samples, MBD enrichment holds the potential to be used to obtain complete genome sequences while measuring ancient methylation levels at the same time. This most certainly restricts the applicability of the method to the most recent and/or most preserved specimens, which represents only a minority of specimens present in the paleontological and archeological record. We, thus, caution against the method for DNA extracts showing significant levels of deamination and fragmentation (e.g. median sizes &#x02264;80&#x02009;bp).</p><p>Ideally, both MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions should be sequenced to help identify regions differentially covered in the two fractions. This might provide in the future an alternative to methods currently available for recovering ancient epigenetic information based on bisulphite conversion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and differential patterns of CpG&#x02192;TpG mutations at methylated and unmethylated sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Given the decrease in endogenous DNA content and the increase in clonality observed for MBD+ libraries, we recommend performing MBD enrichment on large volumes of aDNA extracts whenever possible. This will increase the pool of DNA templates available for enrichment and the molecular complexity of DNA libraries constructed on MBD+ fractions. Alternatively, DNA extracts that have been concentrated following additional purification could be used for MBD enrichment (although this will also lead to a substantial loss of DNA molecules during purification). In recognition of the observed bias towards CpG-rich DNA fragments, we recommend the use of specific DNA polymerases, such as Accuprime <italic>Pfx</italic>, and, more generally, PCR conditions that limit the over-amplification of %GC-rich DNA templates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Other modifications to the procedure described here, for example involving different washing and elution conditions following DNA binding to MBD2&#x02212;Fc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, might also contribute toward releasing the whole diversity of methylated DNA molecules present in the extract and limiting the carry-over of organellar and other unmethylated templates into the MBD+ fraction.</p><p>We note that the observed preference for <sup>m</sup>CpG-rich fragments introduces a bias in the quantification of <italic>post-mortem</italic> DNA degradation. Specifically, DNA templates where <sup>m</sup>CpG sites have been less affected by cytosine deamination &#x02013; the most common aDNA damage &#x02013; are more likely to be enriched. Epialleles also show higher deamination rates while methylated than not. The resultant pool of DNA fragments that make up the MBD+ fraction is, thus, unlikely to reflect the true level of <italic>post-mortem</italic> DNA damage. This observation was first noted by Smith and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, who described deamination reactions at unmethylated and methylated cytosines as two complementary forces, both contributing to the global estimate of <italic>post-mortem</italic> DNA deamination rates.</p><p>Although DNA degradation reactions are known to take place at faster rates with increasing temperature at depositional sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, we observed striking differences in the molecular preservation of the different woolly mammoth tissues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). For Khroma, bone endogenous DNA content was 1.6 to 140-fold higher than in soft tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2.1</xref>), and cytosine deamination occurred up to 2.4-fold slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4.4</xref>). This suggests that DNA degradation and <italic>post-mortem</italic> microbial colonization are greater in soft tissues, most likely due to the rapid collapse of cellular membranes and disruption of the tissue organization, are greater in soft tissues, as previously suggested<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>Our data also indicate that cytosine deamination levels cannot provide a direct estimate of the time since a fossil was buried, since we observed a large variation in cytosine deamination levels at overhangs across the tissues from the same mammoth specimen (Khroma; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4.4</xref>). This contrasts with the linear relationship between time and C&#x02192;T nucleotide misincorporation rates at sequence starts observed by Sawyer and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> in a diversity of preservation environments, but is in line with other studies inside<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and outside<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> permafrost regions, where high variability of deamination rates where observed across DNA libraries prepared from the same bone samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.

The calculation was restricted to samples carrying at least 2,000 collapsed reads. Differences between MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions were statistically assessed by two-sample t-tests performed on mean distributions.

We used samtools depth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref> to retrieve the distribution of coverage for positions covered at least once. Spearman&#x02019;s rank-correlation was carried out on a random subset of two million reads per sample to statistically assess the relationships between MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions for differential coverage per mapping position in the nuclear genome.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Distribution of transposable elements</title><p>We compared MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions for their distribution of TEs using two complementary approaches. First, we used the proportion of reads with one or more sub-optimal reads (non-null X1:i tag and null X0:1 tag) as a proxy for TEs, since TEs represent regions found at multiple copies in the genome. Secondly, we directly estimated the relative amount of repetitive elements in MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions, using the human, equine and elephantid sequence data, as BED annotations for repetitive elements were available from the UCSC Genome Browser and for the polar bear we used the annotation kindly made available by the authors from Liu and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>.

This analysis was restricted to the human and equine data, since BED annotations of those genomes were available for CGIs. Samples showing less than 2,000 collapsed reads mapping to such regions were disregarded to enable reliable coverage estimates.

Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of Bray-Curtis distances among profiles was performed at the genus level using the R function pcoa. Manhattan distance-based relationships amongst profiles were assessed at the genus level by hierarchical clustering using the R package pvclust<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. The support for each cluster was estimated through p-values (Approximately Unbiased and Bootstrap Probabilities) estimated from 10,000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. Further statistical comparisons between the microbial profiles of MBD+ and MBD&#x02212; fractions were carried out using the program LEfSe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Consistent differences in taxon abundances were tested using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test and the unpaired Wilcoxon test. A linear discriminant analysis also estimated the effect size of taxonomical covariates at the origin of the fraction differences (threshold on logarithmic linear discriminant analysis score for discriminative features&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.0).
