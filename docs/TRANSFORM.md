# Transformations

Norma is able to transform or extract information from original documents. These include:

## PDF

### PDF to Image
for PDFBox See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8705163/extract-images-from-pdf-using-pdfbox . We will hope to implement this.

### PDF to Text
we have implemented PDF2TXT which converts PDFs to (hopefully) UTF-8 text.
